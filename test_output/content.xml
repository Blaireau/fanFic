Part of it had to do with finding an angle that justified and made sense of some of the craziness that happens within the games. The other part had to do with the 2013 game being developed seasonally; because of such an unusual development cycle, the game&apos;s story ended up suffering as a result, with barely any sort of cohesion or strong narrative. Some elements are brilliant, but others are either contradictory, real head-scratchers or just downright awful. For the purpose of this story and for the sake of simplicity, I&apos;ll be drawing from mainly KI1 and certain elements of the 2013 game as well, although some slight liberties will be taken in order to reconcile the two. Also, I want to give a shout-out to Star Aquarius, H.R.C. Stanley, Baniac, lulgijak and 10868letsgo for their help - thank you guys so much! I hope you enjoy! ;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prologue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;At the midpoint on the journey of life, I found myself in a dark forest, for the clear path was lost.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;- Canto One, &quot;Dante&apos;s Inferno&quot; by Dante Alighieri&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The night howled against the thick walls of the castle, calling for its occupant.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A figure sat alone at a table, humming aloud as he studied the sheet music in front of him, putting the notes of the tune down onto paper with his pencil. Pausing in his song, he muttered aloud, then tried humming again. Letting out a frustrated growl, the figure released a slew of angry curses in irritation as he erased his error, starting back from the beginning until he worked his way to where he left off.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Two unlit chandeliers hung uselessly overhead, periodically creaking.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Behind him, a sandstone hearth roared and crackled noisily, pouring out its dim light across the ochre stone floor. The sole source of light in the entire room, it illuminated his back as he worked, the orangish hue painting the rest of his environment unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The ochre color of the floor extended upward to a pair of marble Roman Tuscan columns with smooth shafts and the burning hearth between them, their capitals connecting up to the castle&apos;s Gothic rib-like arches. The arches themselves rested against smooth concrete white walls that were disfigured and cracked from age at the top and bottom corners, resembling the decaying hide of an animal. Two feet over the mantel hung a brown clock with two pairs of ornamental bat wings protruding from the top and bottom corners, the clock ticking and winding down. At the left hand corner hung a shield with a pair of crossed sabres, while a self-portrait of Rembrandt watched directly over the figure with keen interest as he worked in the right hand corner.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The sounds of the wind, the clock&apos;s ticking, the crackling of the fireplace, the squeaky hinges of the chandeliers mixed with his tune as he put pen to paper.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He paused as the shrill maniacal laugh came again from upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Tightening his fingers around his pencil, he tried to ignore it, but like the wind outside, the laughter was just as unrelenting, cruel and pitiless, rising and falling, grating on his nerves.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Humming again, he slowly ran his hand through his hair, refraining himself from pulling it out, but as the laugh continued to sound off, the louder he became until he snapped; grabbing an empty wine glass from his desk, he chucked it to the ceiling, smashing it hard against its surface.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;SHUT UP!&quot;&lt;/em&gt; he shrieked as glass rained down onto the fancy rug next to him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;For a moment, the laughter stopped, but then picked up again in a soft tormenting chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His hands traveled to his scalp, grabbing handfuls of hair in exasperation before doubling over, clutching his ears as he was assaulted by the awful sound. Pulling his hands away from his head, the figure hastily grabbed for the cloak that hung from the chair and headed straight out the door as the laugh redoubled in its intensity.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ravensburg, 2013, 6 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Checkmate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad angrily lashed out from the seat of his wheelchair, throwing the chess board from the desk in front of him, spilling the various pieces across the carpeted floor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That wasn&apos;t very nice,&quot; ARIA replied from the speaker on his phone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah?&quot; Konrad growled, &quot;Well, fuck nice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His ears perked as someone knocked at the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come in,&quot; he ordered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The door opened, revealing his faithful servant and long-time friend Jurgen, a tall, broad-shouldered man ten years his senior with thick grey bushy hair, his strong face marked with slight crow&apos;s nests at the corners of his gentle eyes, his sturdy form dressed in a fancy black suit.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is everything alright, Herr Baron?&quot; he asked with concern in German, then cast his glance to the fallen chess pieces, &quot;I take it you&apos;ve lost another game with ARIA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When his employer didn&apos;t respond, Jurgen continued to speak.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t say I blame you, sir - ARIA is a bitch when it comes to competition. I&apos;ve had half a mind to smash her servers on many occasions!&quot; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Upon being met with silence once again, Jurgen cleared his throat nervously. &quot;But it&apos;s as the saying goes, Herr Konrad - &apos;you win some, you lose some.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Win &lt;em&gt;some&apos;? &lt;/em&gt;I just want to win at least&lt;em&gt; once&lt;/em&gt;. At least for once in my life I want to feel like I&apos;m not perpetually losing,&quot; he said lowly, his voice tinged with raw bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh come now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t patronize me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not, mein freund,&quot; Jurgen raised his hands placatingly. &quot;I can scarcely think of many people who could say that they&apos;re heir to a family fortune, let alone graduated from the University of Munich with honors at a young age in business. Hell, how many graduated university or high school at all? How many could say that they&apos;re nobility, own a castle, and have ties to numerous governments across the globe? How many could say that they own a conglomeration as massive and extensive as yours? I can&apos;t even recall anyone or anything out there with the number of subsidiaries that you have, let alone had the amount of influence that you wield to this day. Who could possibly say proudly &quot;I am the CEO of Ultratech&quot; other than you? You made Ultratech possible, and because of that, to paraphrase Shakespeare, the world is now your oyster. That&apos;s not what I would call a loser.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad lowered his head thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You were always good at saying things that please me,&quot; he said with a tiny amount of amusement, then nodded. &quot;It&apos;s true, few could claim to have achieved the level of success that I have had in a single life time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His hand reached upward, his gloved fingers tracing along the fabric of the hood.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;However,&quot; he continued, all traces of humor dropped from his voice, &quot;I have the perfect counterargument.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pulling down his hood from the back of his head, Konrad watched as the man shifted in discomfort from the sight of his face.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s the matter, Jurgen? Nothing else to add? Come on, Jurgen, kiss my ass some more.&quot; Konrad seethed. &quot;Say something about my good looks!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;No response came. Shaking his head in disgust, Konrad raised his hood back up. &quot;Thought as <text:soft-page-break/>much.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A cure will be found, Herr Konrad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;When?!&quot; Konrad demanded, his voice becoming louder with word spewing from his mouth, &quot;I&apos;ve spent my entire life trying to find it. I&apos;m almost fifty years old. Fifty! Do you have any idea what I have lost?! What I stand to lose as this...&quot; he paused, then gestured furiously to his face, &quot;&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; continues?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, yes, I know too well, old friend, but you need to keep your spirits up, sir,&quot; he replied cheerfully. &quot;There&apos;s no point in dwelling on dark thoughts, you&apos;ll only make yourself feel worse. You just need to find something to keep yourself busy. Idle hands are the devil&apos;s playthings, as the saying goes, and that is also why you need to lay off the games with ARIA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad growled in annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m serious, Herr Konrad,&quot; said Jurgen. &quot;Your time is far too valuable to be wasted on such childish activities. Why do you continue doing this to yourself when you should be-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do not lecture me on my priorities!&quot; Konrad interrupted, snarling out the words, causing the servant to stiffen. He resumed talking in a normal voice.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;As it so happens, I was fulfilling my duties to her. She&apos;s a multitasking AI, Jurgen. The &quot;Advanced Robotics Intelligence Architecture&quot;,&quot; he replied, using air quotes in mockery. &quot;Part of the stipulations from that crazy old bat Ryat Adams involves playing games with this piece of junk to help test and improve her systems through her understanding of game theory.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen gave him a disapproving look. &quot;It&apos;s disrespectful to talk ill of the dead like that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah? Well, he&apos;s dead. His troubles are over, mine aren&apos;t. Fuck him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron!&quot; Jurgen scowled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What?!&quot; Konrad demanded. &quot;I never met the man, let alone knew him. He died in 1981, for god&apos;s sake, why should I treat him with reverence? If it hadn&apos;t been for the fact that I wanted to purchase his nuclear power company I wouldn&apos;t have heard of him or this...irritation. You know why I have to put up with this day after day? The senile old fart believed that ARIA would &quot;change the world&quot; and that it would save his wife from whatever ailment she had at the time. Fah! Fat lot it did him! I reckon that the death of his wife caused Ryat to crack, otherwise he wouldn&apos;t have included ARIA in his will and set such bizarre terms and conditions. If it weren&apos;t for that, I&apos;d have sooner tossed it into the trash where it belongs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But surely ARIA can be used to help figure out your condition, maybe provide a treatment-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;ARIA is worthless.&quot; Konrad interrupted. &quot;Nothing more than a bothersome obligation by a sentimental, idealistic, broken old man with delusions of grandeur. He relied on ARIA to help him with his wife. She failed him. He wants her to &quot;save the world&quot;, and I&apos;m not going to even comment on the ludicrousness of that. I&apos;ll honor the terms of his will, but I&apos;m not going to make the same mistake as him and rely on this junky piece of shit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;There was a long moment of silence in the dimly lit office.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Was there anything else?&quot; he demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen cleared his throat.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, you wanted me to remind you of your 9 a.m. appointment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah Christ,&quot; Konrad swore, pinching the bridge of his nose. &quot;I&apos;ve forgotten all about that. Which appointment was it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s the meeting with the other Board members, Mr. Chairman.&quot; ARIA said from the speaker, startling both men. Konrad hated how ARIA sometimes did that. The idea of an AI listening in and talking like an actual person in the room was very disconcerting at times. Konrad wondered if ARIA had heard what he had said about her. If she had, she gave no indication of having done so. He reminded himself to make sure when speaking to someone that ARIA&apos;s microphone and speaker were turned off.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, ja, thank you, ARIA,&quot; Konrad replied, nodding in acknowledgement, &quot;I&apos;ll vid-screen them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wouldn&apos;t recommend that, Mr. Chairman. Your presence is needed in order to sign some legal <text:soft-page-break/>documents.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have someplace to get to urgently, ARIA.&quot; he said, grabbing a scarf and a pair of thick sunglasses from his desk.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where?&quot; the AI inquired.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s business-related,&quot; Konrad replied as he secured each article of clothing around his features, making sure nothing of his face was visible. &quot;Tell the Board members and the lawyers that I won&apos;t be able to attend in person, that I&apos;ll vid-screen them and come down later to sign whatever needs signing. What is the rest of my schedule?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen took a black leather day timer out from his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Eh, you have a meeting with Dr. Gupte, followed by four hours of workout, karate and capoeira with your trainer Tyler Zhou back here at the castle.&quot; he read.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Uhhh,&quot; Konrad groaned. &quot;The man&apos;s a bloody sadist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen tsked, &quot;Now, now, Herr Konrad. I know you&apos;re not crazy about him, but you have been putting on some weight lately.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad glared at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what do you mean by that?&quot; he demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The servant hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; he said slowly trying to find the right words, &quot;...for your age and height, your weight isn&apos;t...ideal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The hooded figure tensed. &quot;I&apos;m five-eleven.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even so, four hundred pounds is...excessive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I liked you better when you were being an obsequious little shit.&quot; he grumbled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen gave a short laugh. It was to his credit that he was able to put up with Konrad&apos;s antics throughout the years. If it hadn&apos;t been for the fact that Jurgen and his family had long served the Sabrewulf household for generations and were steadfast in their loyalty, Konrad wouldn&apos;t have tolerated him and his remarks, let alone grant him power of attorney. It also explained why Jurgen was so patient with him, even at his worst.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad rolled the wheel chair out from his office, then waited as Jurgen locked up behind him. Pulling a cellphone out from his pocket, Konrad dialed a number and placed it to his ear.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter, tell Heinrich, Michael and the others to get the car ready as soon as possible, we&apos;re going to Austria,&quot; he said as Jurgen wheeled him down the vast hallways and corridors, then hung up and put it away once he was finished.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s in Austria, Herr Baron?&quot; Jurgen asked as he wheeled him throughout the mansion.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got a tip-off from a source that there&apos;s going to be an auction,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah hell, not another one!&quot; the servant muttered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes thank you, Jurgen,&quot; Konrad said, trying to keep hold of his temper.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what is it that you hope to find?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t know,&quot; Jurgen repeated, nodding sarcastically. &quot;Well, that&apos;s great.

Enough is enough already.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The two men were silent for a moment as they wheeled though the hallway, the air filled with tension.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Konrad, you should know that nothing will come from this,&quot; the servant said. &quot;There is no such thing as magic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do I look like, some naïve schoolboy? I know that magic isn&apos;t real, Blödmann! And yes, Jurgen, I haven&apos;t forgotten about my past failures. How can I? I still remember the various shitty herbal teas, the disgusting foods that made me vomit along with the crackpot ceremonies and exorcisms. I still haven&apos;t forgotten about that bloody white shaman idiot that had bedecked me in that fucking feather headdress! Dieter still has pictures of that on his cell phone. It&apos;s only from the grace of God and a very big cheque book that I was able to keep a lid on this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then why do you continue with this occult crap?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad was quiet for a moment, then lifted his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it too much for a man in my condition to have hope?&quot; he asked quietly. &quot;To believe that there may be a way? Even an unconventional one?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that is exactly what has me worried, Herr Baron,&quot; he said. &quot;These maggots feed on people like you, people that are desperate and vulnerable .&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well thank you for that vote of confidence, Jurgen!&quot; Konrad snapped.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron, I know how these shitheads work. They&apos;re grubby little parasites - fucking people over is an art form and a lucrative business for them, and once they&apos;ve latched on they&apos;ll suck you dry. What&apos;s worse is that not only do you continue to take punishment time after time, but you&apos;re only too happy to oblige. It nearly ruined you, Herr Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know that!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It was partially why he had decided go into business and form Ultratech in the first place; by having a better understanding of the law, he could find ways to generate income through legal means, and with his numerous contacts and dividends at hand, Konrad was able to achieve a solid and sustainable safety net for himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look, you and I have been friends for years, Herr Konrad. I hate seeing a friend being taken advantage of, but it also turns my stomach when he&apos;s as self-destructive as you are. What makes this source of yours more reliable than the other losers?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;He&apos;s the one who gave me my voice back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hearing that made the servant stiffen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You disapprove of him,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Him&lt;/em&gt; especially!&quot; Jurgen said lowly and viciously. &quot;The hairs on the back of my neck stand on end just from mentioning that...cretin! He is the worst of the lot, a practiced veteran in the art of fucking people over that also believes in the bullshit he&apos;s selling. To be quite honest with you, Herr Baron, I would not be surprised if that man had skeletons in his closet. Real ones, too.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn&apos;t realize that a mere peddler can get under your skin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Frankly I don&apos;t know how he hasn&apos;t gotten under yours, Herr Baron - the man&apos;s a freak. Everything about him is warped - his &lt;em&gt;eyes&lt;/em&gt;, his &lt;em&gt;skin&lt;/em&gt;, that &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt;, that&lt;em&gt; look&lt;/em&gt; he gives when he &lt;em&gt;smiles&lt;/em&gt;...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He shuddered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t stand him.

The man was gone, long gone. What was left behind was an empty shell. He had to be chained like an animal in the old dungeon in the basement until the day he-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He stopped, the words leaving him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen placed a comforting hand on his shoulder, then gave a strong pat.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking a moment to recover, Konrad raised a hand up to his face, then glanced briefly in the servant&apos;s direction.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have reservations about the man myself, Jurgen. &lt;em&gt;Very&lt;/em&gt; strong reservations. But he helped me gain back some of my...humanity.

How long had it been since he just decided to go for a drive, let alone take a walk, just for the pleasure of being able to go anywhere he wanted?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Must have been close to twenty years,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought wistfully.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As an expensive Jaguar passed, a sudden feeling of nostalgia swept over him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He remembered how in his youth he was a dashing and impetuous teenager, taking his father&apos;s cars out for a drive through Ravensburg, much to the chagrin of Jurgen&apos;s father.*&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He vividly recalled how as a boy he used to love playing hide and seek in the forest with Jurgen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Since the worsening of his condition, however, Konrad found himself a prisoner in his own home, unable to go outside for fear of being spotted and photographed. Even though the castle was isolated, with no neighbouring houses or villages for miles, surrounded by mountains and forests, he could never channel the courage to take a stroll through the woods. Hell, he couldn&apos;t even bring himself to step out into his back garden for fear of stumbling upon some nosy villager, reporter or some damn guard on patrol.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;How ironic,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad thought bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;His castle mansion was renowned for having the best security systems money could buy, perfect for keeping everyone out, but the very same security systems and personnel prevented Konrad from doing the very things he longed for, keeping him confined to both the damn wheel chair and to certain sections inside the mansion itself, further entrenching those feelings of being a prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He used to love playing hide and seek as a child. How like Fate to take the thing he loved and make it into something he hated; all he ever did nowadays was hide.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is everything alright, Herr Baron?&quot; his chauffeur Heinrich, a blonde man in an old fashioned uniform complete with breeches, a black double-breasted coat and matching chauffeur cap, asked in German.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad grunted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just wondering.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;About what, sir?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Time, Heinrich,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Time, and where it all went.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His chauffeur quietly digested what was said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Beside Konrad sat his three bodyguards Lawrence, Michael, and Roger. Dressed in black with their eyes concealed by reflector sunglasses, the men looked like they were carved from stone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Opposite Konrad sat his loyal right-hand man, friend, and bodyguard Dieter, a slim but tall American of indeterminate age with dark slicked-back hair, dressed in a grey suit with matching overcoat, black sunglasses, shirt, tie and shoes, silently brushing his equally grey broad brimmed fedora. A habitual gambler and womanizer, Dieter had first met Konrad at Las Vegas when he was in his twenties. The former had intervened on the latter&apos;s behalf by exposing the dodgy tactics of certain casino players, resulting in the Baron not only getting his money back but also said-players being permanently banned. Unfortunately, the people called out took issue with Dieter&apos;s interference and had decided to repay him by ambushing him in a parking lot late at night when no one was around. It was only through Konrad&apos;s intervention that he was able to survive the experience. Since then, the two became inseparable.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Overhead, hovercars buzzed around noisily like giant flies.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You do realize that if we had one of those we could have gotten from Ravensburg to Austria in less than 5 hours, sir?&quot; Heinrich said, gesturing to the vehicles flying above.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hover cars require a pilot&apos;s license, Heinrich, which you don&apos;t have.&quot; Konrad explained. &quot;Even more, if we were to get into an accident, chances are more than likely that we wouldn&apos;t survive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bah, I could ace that test, no problem!&quot; he proclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re barely tolerable even on the ground,&quot; Konrad said humorously as he pulled a laptop from a bag next to his bodyguard Michael.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Heinrich smirked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everyone be quiet, the meeting is about to begin,&quot; Konrad said in English and German as he set up the computer on his lap. Once he had Internet connection, he thoroughly checked his security and encryption settings, then the firewall, making certain that everything was in working order and that nothing allowed for some little shithead hacker to get into his system, let alone his corporation&apos;s. The last thing he wanted was for some rival or whoever to broadcast this meeting to the rest of the world. Once he was satisfied, Konrad taped a small piece of cloth over the laptop&apos;s camera at the top of the monitor, then activated the vid-screen, watching the monitor as it flickered, revealing a group of men and women in a white room surrounding a massive oval table.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, Guttentag, mein freunds!&quot; Konrad greeted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good morning, Mr. Chairman,&quot; everyone greeted from the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is everyone here?&quot; he asked in English. &quot;I can see the windows for Cairo, Britain, Spain, Sweden, Russia, our American friends, but I don&apos;t see some of the other branches. Oh, there&apos;s Mexico and the South American branch. Africa&apos;s now arrived, but where&apos;s Tokyo and Hong-ah! There they are. Good to see you, gentlemen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, Mr. Chairman!&quot; a familiar low voice with a crisp Queen&apos;s English accent said through the <text:soft-page-break/>speaker.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad glanced back to the main window as David Kellog, Chief Operating Officer of Ultratech, entered the room smiling at the screen, &quot;I am so glad to hear from you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A partially bald, eagle-faced man dressed in a nice navy suit, even on a tiny screen monitor Konrad could tell how fake the little bastard was.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;I hope you get piles,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought venomously. &lt;em&gt;&apos;Big, lumpy melons dangling from your ass!&apos;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;David!&quot; he greeted in a cheerful and enthusiastic tone. &quot;My goodness, it&apos;s been such a long time! How&apos;s the family?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David laughed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, everything is well, thank you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I understand your son has managed to become a successful millionaire already!

Before that he had made only two million.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Oh fuck off!&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad thought. &lt;em&gt;&apos;I hope you, your two-faced bitch of a wife Janet and that creepy cross-eyed brat of yours all get horribly sick and die.&apos;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only thing stopping my boy from earning 50 million is A Dead Rat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad raised a brow, then looked to the other people in the stretch limo questioningly in puzzlement, wondering if they knew what the man was talking about. All gave him equally perplexed looks, with Dieter shrugging.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; he asked, uncertain if he had heard correctly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s the user name of the top player - &quot;A Dead Rat&quot;,&quot; David explained. &quot;He&apos;s always one step ahead.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah. Well, such is the way of the world,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately.&quot; David agreed. &quot;By the way, we seem to be having some issues with your video feed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can hear you, but you&apos;re not showing up on the monitor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bah, the camera&apos;s busted,&quot; Konrad lied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you need help?

We&apos;ll start off with the Applied Sciences/Research and Development, then follow that up with Finances, and then Entertainment. Our first item concerns the UA-CCIX &quot;Kilgore&quot; heavy assault android unit. As all of you may know, the project&apos;s leader Dr. Kilgore was killed while they were running diagnostic tests on its chaingun forearms. Due to the hazardous nature of the machine, the project has been put on hold until further notice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can anyone explain why those are even a feature?&quot; One of the women asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mjolnir Initiative guidelines,&quot; David explained.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mjolnir Initiative?&quot; she repeated.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad rolled his eyes while David frowned in her direction.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;ll have to forgive Carol, Mr. Kellog,&quot; a man said beside her. &quot;She&apos;s new here. She&apos;s from Finances.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He nodded in understanding.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;In that case, Carol, I&apos;ll give you a very quick and brief history lesson. In order to understand this curious design, you have to appreciate the decisions that led up to that point. Combat androids have been around since the early 2000s. Nimble and efficient in both armed and unarmed combat, they proved to be of tremendous value to militaries around the globe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Quick and brief, David,&quot; Konrad reminded impatiently.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unfortunately, it had been found that various militias, terrorist organizations and guerilla groups would intentionally target them in order to gain access to the firearms that they were supplied with, which in turn caused quite a stir among the public.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh dear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; David nodded, &quot;and since nobody at the company wants to be accused of supplying these groups, an executive decision was made. Thus, the Mjolnir Initiative was decreed, the purpose being to create combat androids with built-in weaponry that would inconvenience the enemy and prevent the potential armament of such organizations, which is why current android models have such unique features such as firearms mounted on the forelimbs, self-destruct mechanisms, laser weaponry from the eyes with modular settings that ranged from stun to causing severe burns...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh, now I see.&quot; said Carol.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can we get back to the issue at hand, please?&quot; Konrad demanded. &quot;We&apos;re wasting very valuable time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, Mr. Chairman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, this Kilgore android, what&apos;s wrong with it exactly?&quot; one of the Board members asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It suffers from a severe overheating issue that causes it to catch fire due to its archaic combustion engine,&quot; a woman from the R and D Department explained.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are we liable for a potential lawsuit?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fortunately no, Mr. Chairman,&quot; David responded. &quot;We&apos;ve had our legal department review all of the data concerning Dr. Kilgore and the incident itself. From all indications, he was the one at fault, not us. The man had recklessly disregarded protocol - he had already been warned several times regarding the dangers of running diagnostics with live ammunition. Hell, we had to revoke his security clearance because of the man&apos;s erratic behavior.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;If his clearance had been revoked,&quot; Konrad said slowly, &quot;then why is he dead? How did he get in?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Apparently he had stolen an intern&apos;s ID card.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah. I suppose that compensation has been issued to Kilgore&apos;s family?&quot; Konrad asked concernedly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, yes,&quot; David answered, &quot;although I&apos;d say it&apos;s too generous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Always were a class-act, weren&apos;t you, David?&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad thought with contempt. &quot;What&apos;s the status of the machine?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;As of this moment it&apos;s been secured in storage,&quot; said the woman from R and D.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why don&apos;t we replace the engine?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We could try to, but in all honesty it would only incur further expenses, especially if we were to find the appropriate engines that can guarantee better performance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is the project salvageable at all?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The woman sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;In my honest opinion, no.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s no way we can still use the Kilgore android?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not unless you want the machines to explode and have a mountain of lawsuits filed against you by grieving soldiers&apos; families, Mr. Chairman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad blinked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean by &quot;machines&quot;? How many units were built?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A few hundred.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad tightened his gloved hands into fists, resisting the urge to punch through the monitor. As the leather tightened around his knuckles, he growled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He watched as the people on the screen glanced to one another questioningly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where&apos;s that coming from?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whose dog is that?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is that from your end?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;My end? I don&apos;t have a dog!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Mr. Chairman, but someone&apos;s pet seems to have snuck into where they are and is now growling into the microphone,&quot; David explained.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have ears, David!&quot; Konrad snapped.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Inhaling through his nostrils, he got his temper down as best he could.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whoever that is,&quot; he said with clenched teeth, &quot;take your pet out of the room. If it&apos;s not someone&apos;s pet, then please shut down whatever TV set, YouTube video, phone or sound effects board you are watching. This is a business meeting, not the Discovery Channel.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once everyone settled down, David looked into the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am so sorry about that Mr. Chairman,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let&apos;s just continue.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David bent his head down in embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can someone tell me how it&apos;s possible that a hundred units were even made when we&apos;re still trying to build&lt;em&gt; one&lt;/em&gt; working prototype?&quot; Konrad muttered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The others were outsourced and mass manufactured by a company in India at reduced costs.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of our shell companies?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Naturally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad sighed. Perhaps the damage wouldn&apos;t be as bad as he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How much is this going to cost us?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Mitchel Sacket, the Chief Financial Officer, spoke from the corner, &quot;We&apos;re still running the numbers, but our best estimates are in the low ten million range, if not less.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Damn. Even though the worst case scenario was only a few million, Konrad was still annoyed at such a loss. Every bit of currency mattered, especially for him. What especially annoyed him, though, was that this fuckup was allowed to even happen in the first place. Someone should have <text:soft-page-break/>caught on, and he didn&apos;t know whether to pin it entirely on Kilgore or not. He mentally reminded himself to review the data concerning personnel later. Someone was going to be fired.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How would you like to proceed, Mr. Chairman?&quot; David asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He thought for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We scrap the project,&quot; Konrad decided. &quot;Decommission the units and send all but one to the scrapheap.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why do you want to save one?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I like to think there&apos;s something of potential value that we might learn from for reference in future combat models.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And if it doesn&apos;t?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then we&apos;ll have another piece to add to Ultratech&apos;s museum collection, something to honor Kilgore&apos;s memory.&quot; Konrad said thoughtfully. &quot;Personally, I think it would look nice somewhere next to the decommissioned Hercules combat mech.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ll put it to a vote. All those in favor of the Chairman&apos;s proposition?&quot; David asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Everyone raised their hands.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;All against?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;No one opposed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very well,&quot; David said, &quot;although we&apos;ll still need to find something to fill that void left behind by the Kilgore project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;All in good time, David. We&apos;ll discuss the possibilities during our next meeting,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David looked back to the list.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you wish. Moving on, item two. It&apos;s been brought to my attention, Mr. Chairman, that you&apos;ve seconded one of our geneticists, one Dr. Erin Gupte, along with vast amounts of lab equipment and personnel to your home, among other things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed. I have been making alterations to my castle to best accommodate them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;May I ask why?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Due to the sensitive nature of their work along with there being evidence of a possible mole, I felt it best to have them kept under close observation by my men and by myself personally.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh for goodness sake, Konrad, you&apos;re not on that again!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Someone had been close to transmitting information about those clinical trials in hair products to an encrypted outside source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And we caught the one responsible!&quot; David protested. &quot;We had him arrested and tried.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, but until we know for certain that he had no accomplice, I&apos;m not going to risk it.&quot; Konrad said firmly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;That, plus it would allow me to use my company&apos;s resources in treating my condition,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He watched as David&apos;s lips tensed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fine,&quot; he answered. Konrad&apos;s ears twitched as he heard the man mutter about him being paranoid.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Moving on, item three concerns cybernetic implants. I&apos;ll let Director Cho fill you all in on the details. Take it way, Sean.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Thirty minutes later...&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And finally, Mr. Chairman, our last item concerns your...program,&quot; David said in distaste.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As a young man, Konrad vigorously exercised both his body and mind in the hopes of staving off his condition. At the recommendation of Jurgen, he took up martial arts, studying boxing, karate and capoeira. However, as he got better in martial arts, the more competitive Konrad became. The more he practiced, the more he craved the opportunity to fight a worthy opponent, for there was something empowering in using his own body as a weapon and moving it in ways one would have <text:soft-page-break/>never anticipated. He remembered the raw satisfaction he had felt when he did his first cartwheel, the elation he had experienced when he did his first backspin, and the joy of his first somersault. Even greater was the sensation he had experienced when he used this knowledge to win a fight, in being able to outmatch, outsmart and overpower an opponent.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He felt free in a way he never had experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Free from his worries, free from the laws of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He felt superhuman.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Even more, he felt happy.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;However, happiness came at a price. Even though he had participated in numerous martial arts competitions, winning a number of gold trophies, much to his satisfaction, he couldn&apos;t get enough of it. Whether it was due to the competitive streak, an addictive personality, some atavistic part of him brought out by his affliction, his ego or something else altogether, Konrad sought competition wherever he could find it, often in seedy underground fight clubs and street fights. When images of him cropped up on the internet, problems started to emerge for Konrad.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1994&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Do you realize what this could mean for the company?&quot; David said to Konrad in his office at the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Oh come on, David.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t &quot;come on David&quot; me, Konrad, there are photos of you in that fight club online! Even more, there are videos of you!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;And if you look carefully they also have photos and videos of Michael Jackson doing the foxtrot with George Bush and a skunk, along with videos of Jean Claude Van Damme in bed with a goat on Mars. So what?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&quot;So what&quot;?! Konrad, criminal charges could be filed!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;For what? I haven&apos;t done anything wrong. Really, David, you shouldn&apos;t believe everything you hear on the internet. There is such a thing as &quot;Photoshop&quot;, &quot;photo manipulation&quot;, &quot;3d animation&quot; and &quot;video editing software&quot;.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Konrad, I know all about your little dalliances with those types of places, so let&apos;s cut the bullshit, alright?&quot; David said sternly. &quot;The only reason why I don&apos;t report you to the authorities is because we have been friends for a long time. If you continue with this, I won&apos;t be able to protect you from the potential scandal this will spell for you and the company. The Board of Directors will not take kindly to the notion that the CEO is a pugilist thug and will vote you off. I advise you to think long and hard.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Konrad was silent for a moment, then lifted his eyes to his.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Is that all?&quot; he asked quietly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; Konrad whispered, then slowly started to raise his voice. &quot;Because I want to let you know, David, that I don&apos;t take kindly to threats. How dare you insult me, ME, Baron Konrad Von Sabrewulf, of something so common and unbecoming of my character and rank?! If it wasn&apos;t for the fact that we&apos;re friends I&apos;d not only fire you from MY company and sue you for every miserable cent that you have for these grotesque and slanderous allegations, but I&apos;d also ensure that nobody would ever hire you again due to the muck on your reputation! Two can play this game, David, and between us I think you know who the clear winner is going to be. Don&apos;t. Fuck. With. Me.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;You&apos;re not the only one with friends,&quot; David growled. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Not in the high places as I do. One thing you fail to understand is that when you get into a fight with a member of the Sabrewulf family, you better be prepared for a fight, because a Sabrewulf will go after you with everything they got to the bitter end no matter the odds, tooth and claw. That has been the family motto and way since the Middle Ages, David, and will continue to be with my dying breath - &quot;Tooth and claw&quot;, mein freund. Tooth and fucking claw,&quot; he spat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two men stared each other down, their jaws tightened and eyes narrowed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;You want an answer? You&apos;ll get one,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Tomorrow I&apos;ll issue a press conference to address these foul rumors, now get out of my home, I&apos;m going to call my attorney to fill him in on the details of what is actually going on.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;David stormed off as Konrad picked up the phone on his desk. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Through his various connections, Konrad was able to quash the allegations made against him. Realizing the potential danger of being discovered again, the potential for blackmail and the very real possibility of his not being so lucky a second time round with the law, he had racked his brain for an answer when he had an epiphany. Thus, the Killer Instinct tournament was born, a no-holds-barred martial arts pay-per-view program that was both televised and streamed live on the internet, personally established, hosted and indulged by Konrad himself. That was, until his condition started to manifest itself more prominently in his mid-thirties/early forties, at which point he had to pass off his responsibilities as host to another.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you wish to discuss about the program, David?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you are aware, ratings haven&apos;t exactly been stellar these last few months, and with the copyright expiration date coming up, the Board members and I are wondering what to expect,&quot; he explained. &quot;Should we file for a renewal at the Copyright Office, or is this a dead duck?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I suggest we wait until the results come in,&quot; Konrad answered. He then smirked. &quot;We have planned a very special final episode for this season tonight that will knock the ratings board out of the park.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh good. Care to fill us in?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;d prefer to not spoil the surprise,&quot; he teased. &quot;I&apos;m keeping it close to the chest, as you say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Chairman,&quot; David said impatiently. &quot;Now isn&apos;t the time for games.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Calm yourself, mein freund. I&apos;m well aware of the consequences should it not pan out. All I ask is for the Board&apos;s continued patience and for you all to see the program at nine o&apos;clock tonight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He heard murmurs throughout the room on his laptop.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very well, and that concludes our meeting, ladies and gentlemen. We&apos;ll send you all an email confirming the next appointment date, and if it doesn&apos;t fit with any of your schedules please let us know so that we can best accommodate you,&quot; David said. &quot;Have a good day, everyone.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad deactivated everything, then shut down his monitor. Closing it on his lap, he looked to the others.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, gentlemen, what did you think?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Meh, I wasn&apos;t paying attention for the most part,&quot; Dieter admitted, &quot;although that bit about how his kid was making millions off of video games kind of makes me sick to think about.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The other men grunted in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Does it make you want a career change? Just think, Dieter, all you&apos;d have to do is sit on your ass all day and twiddle your thumbs on a thumbstick. The only downside is that you&apos;ll have to compete with &quot;A Dead Rat&quot;.&quot; Konrad said amusedly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter tilted his head in mock contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hn, that is quite the dilemma. You&apos;ve really put me in a tight spot, Baron. Decisions, decisions.&quot; he said, then shrugged. &quot;Fuck it, I think I&apos;ll stick with the dog I know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad glared as he and the other men laughed, but let the remark slide.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not &quot;dog&quot;,&quot; he corrected bitterly. &quot;It&apos;s &quot;devil&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The stretch limousine stopped in front of the auction house. People watched nonchalantly as the driver stepped out from the vehicle along with four other men from the back, walked over to the rear and opened the trunk, removing a collapsible wheel chair from within. Once the chair was set up, they rolled it to the right toward the passenger section at the back facing the auction house itself, then opened the car door. The men reached in and carefully carried out the sixth figure from the <text:soft-page-break/>limo, a strange person with a short though wide frame. Clad in a long black overcoat, the person&apos;s features were concealed beneath a hood, a pair of sunglasses and a scarf, while a blanket was draped around his legs and feet. Grunting with exertion, the men plopped him into the wheel chair, then straightened themselves up.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll pick you up when you finished, Herr Konrad,&quot; the driver called as the four men wheeled him up the ramp and into the auction house.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Inside people conversed and laughed amongst themselves while being served drinks by service androids as the strange group entered the large hallway, briefly stopping to cast odd glances at the cloaked wheelchair-bound figure. Rounding to the left, the men entered the auditorium, the sounds of conversation cacophonous, echoing off the walls. A small dog that was sitting contentedly and quietly in a well-dressed woman&apos;s arms several aisles away startled everyone as it suddenly lifted itself up, barking loudly and ferociously with teeth bared at the wheelchair-bound figure as he passed by and rolled toward the stage at the front.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Quiet, Gustav!&quot; the woman scowled in German, shocked by the animal&apos;s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the devil is the matter with him?&quot; her husband asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said as she tried shushing the dog.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can you shut that damn thing up, please?&quot; another man asked in annoyance. &quot;I&apos;m on the phone with someone!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, but something&apos;s really upset him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You shouldn&apos;t have taken your bloody dog along,&quot; a woman behind them hissed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I assure you, my dog has never acted like this in his entire life! He&apos;s usually quiet, well-behaved and very friendly!&quot; the woman insisted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Madam, please take that dog out of the building or else I will call security,&quot; the bid caller said into a microphone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Both man and woman got up from their seats, their faces cast down in embarrassment as they left the auditorium with their still furiously barking pet. Meanwhile, the wheelchair-bound figure and his colleagues settled by the foot of the stage as it began.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched the auction with mild disinterest as the auctioneer showcased the first batch of items.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Although there was a wonderful collection with a wide range, from exotic jewellery, paintings, Grecian amphoras, kouros statues and Roman imitations to African tribal art and Ming vases, nothing had really captured the Baron&apos;s interest. Flurries of hands reached into the air as they made higher and higher bids, but he tuned them out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Sighing, he turned to look over at Dieter to indicate to him and the others that they were leaving when he was overcome by a very strange sensation, a pull toward the stage. Glancing up, he stared at the object now on display.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It was an exceptionally ugly piece, a crudely made clay mask with two gaping eyeholes, a squat, barely existent nose that had gaping nostrils and an open mouth devoid of a lower jaw. Along the sides of the mask were what seemed to be stylized hair pieces or representations of hair made from gilded gold and copper that were overlaid on top of each other, the latter patinated from age. Positioned at the top of the mask were two opposite-facing crescent structures that rested against a patinated triangle, their backs spaced about two to three inches apart.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad gave the structures a onceover.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;They appeared to represent either crescent moons or horns, although he was uncertain which. Connecting the two crescent moons together at the top was a ring or a handle, possibly representing the moon, but a noticeable part of said-ring was chipped.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;At a glance, it was just an ugly and unremarkable-looking ritual mask.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;However, as Konrad listened to the bid caller, the more curious he became; not only were the crescents and ring made from bone, but according to the description pamplet and the caller, the entire section of clay that composed the artifact&apos;s &quot;face&quot; had been overlaid with human skin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the &quot;Mask of the Ancients&quot;, the artifact&apos;s pedigree was less than certain. The bid caller said that it was possibly Mesopotamian due to the gold and copper, with the representations of the three moons having connection to the goddess Innana and the moon god Suen, while the patinated triangle represented Enki, the god of magic. The main face, however, either represented Ereshkigal, the goddess of the underworld, or her fearsome husband Nergal, though it was uncertain as to which. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the mask, Konrad noted how the other buyers were less than enthused about the item as they whispered their disdain to each other.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Good,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought. Less chance of there being a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s hand twitched in anticipation as the auctioneer began to ask for bids.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of all the things to buy, Konrad, why did you have to get &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?&quot; Dieter asked with disgust in the limo.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I take it you&apos;re not a fan, Dieter?&quot; Konrad asked in English.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hell no, it gives me the creeps,&quot; the bodyguard said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn&apos;t realize that you were so easily spooked by mere trinkets,&quot; Konrad said in amusement.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look at it. Who the hell would want that as their mantelpiece?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad sighed as he glanced down to his latest purchase in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It really is ugly, isn&apos;t it?&quot; he laughed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So why did you buy it?&quot; Dieter asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad frowned.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is hard to explain,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;When the bid caller showcased this I-I felt something. I can&apos;t explain it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe it was magic.&quot; Came the sarcastic response.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s true, Dieter. It was like I was drawn to it. I just felt this urge to buy it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard gave him a concerned and doubtful look, then glanced to the other men.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Was it worth eight thousand euros?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad growled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it wasn&apos;t for that little bastard who kept driving up the price every time I made a bid I would have gotten it at a cheaper price,&quot; he said bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what are you going to do with it, Herr Baron?&quot; Michael asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Probably have it as a paperweight on my office desk,&quot; he said. &quot;I wonder if I can still get a tax deduction from this. Remind me later to consult someone who specializes in this sort of thing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s ears perked up as the ringtone for a cell phone went off, then watched as Dieter pulled it out from his pant pocket and raised it to his ear.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes?&quot; he answered. &quot;Uh huh? Alright. Yeah, I&apos;ll let him know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Placing a hand to the speaker, Dieter looked over to Konrad.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have good news - my contact was able to get the items you were looking for,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Excellent. Tell Mr. Ferris that he&apos;ll get the rest of his money,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking his hand away, Dieter resumed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Same place as last time?&quot; he asked. &quot;Okay, got it. I&apos;ll meet you at six. Don&apos;t be late.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Dieter hung up, Konrad placed the ugly mask back into its brown cardboard box and handed it to Michael.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Take me to work, Heinrich.

For eons it had waited at the bottom of the ocean floor. Unable to sleep, unable to dream or die, it merely lied there, waiting. It had searched endlessly throughout the centuries, but on every occasion, its efforts were foiled, forcing it back into stasis&lt;em&gt; until the call would come again. Schools of fish darted away in panic as it stirred, causing mud and debris to form a thick dark cloud. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can you turn on the radio, Heinrich?&quot; Konrad called from the back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jawohl,&quot; the driver said as music came on. &quot;Anything specific you want to hear, Herr Baron?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The news channel, if you please.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Chopin melted into disco, then faded into rap, then shifted into Justin Bieber, causing Konrad to curl his lip in disgust before shifting again to a news anchorwoman talking about weather forecasts, then a political scandal involving a New York Mayor, prostitutes and millions of dollars in cocaine. One news item talked about stocks and trades, while another talked about the discovery of a very large and unusually shaped turnip, which caused some of the men in the limo to raise eyebrows and laugh in amusement.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shifted his attention back outside, to the cityscape and the various billboards and holographic displays in neon. One particular billboard caught his eyes as the limo passed it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ultratech - Looking to the Past to Preserve the Future.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad smirked beneath his scarf. He couldn&apos;t have thought of a better slogan for his company. Hell, it was a perfect slogan for himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The news items blurred into each other, causing him to tune out, until one particular item made him lift his head with a start.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;In other news, tensions are on the rise in Tibet following the attack on a Tibetan monastery. According to officials, several monks were brutally beaten by a man in a ski mask after he had purportedly stolen some holy relics and sacred texts. The men are now hospitalized and under intensive care. Witnesses were unable to give a clear description.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s frame stiffened, his stomach churning as the woman rambled on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you okay, Herr Baron?&quot; Heinrich called.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein,&quot; he said. &quot;Turn it off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Obeying, the limousine became dead silent.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought you said the man was a professional.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;He is,&quot; Dieter replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then what the hell was that?!&quot; Konrad roared. &quot;He attacked &lt;em&gt;Tibetan monks&lt;/em&gt;!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll find out everything I can as soon as I meet with him.

There are no CCTVs. The police there are known to turn a blind eye and are bloody corrupt. Once you go in, you are at their mercy. These are the kind of folk who would not think twice about hurting a man in wheel chair.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then I&apos;ll go without it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard growled in exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron, please!&quot; he appealed. &quot;People could still take photos of you on their cellphones, and if they do people will start asking very uncomfortable questions!

Known derogatorily as &quot;the Pit&quot;, it was a stretch of shoddy, rundown buildings and houses, the windows of the latter either boarded up, broken and/or stained. It was rare to find anything in this place in pristine condition, let alone free from grime or graffiti, and there was plenty of the latter around. No matter where the duo turned or went, there was always graffiti of some form or another on a building, usually depicting phallic imagery, breasts, human or demonic faces, pentagrams, swastikas and gang insignias, although there were occasional quotes, phrases or words in different stylized fonts and colors. Sometimes one could find a whole dialogue exchange in this mess, although they rarely seemed intellectually stimulating. Often it was just racially inflammatory and sexist crap.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Like an online forum,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad thought as he took note of the graffiti exchange.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pink neon lights stained the street, advertising brightly triple-X rated entertainment, strip clubs and sex paraphernalia, while opposite of them were pawn shops.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A group of women dressed in long coats, revealing dresses, miniskirts and high heels greeted the two men. To Konrad, the women looked like clowns. It didn&apos;t help that some of them stared at him, particularly at the very peculiar gait in his walk. He could only thank god that the cloak had been long enough to conceal his legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey fellas,&quot; a blonde woman with thick make-up and lipstick said with a sultry smile. &quot;Wanna party?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No thank you,&quot; Dieter said firmly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Aw, too bad, honey,&quot; another pouted, then went over to Konrad and placed her arm around his. &quot;How about your friend with the funny walk?

His skin was practically pulled taught against his bones.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey Mister, could you spare some change?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Piss off, junkie,&quot; Dieter said in contempt.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The man hollered after them, cursing as they continued down the path.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A youth in brown clothes ran down in the opposite direction on the other side of the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;In an alleyway that the duo came upon, a man lay against the wall unmoving, holding a bottle in one hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad averted his eyes away, trying to shut out everything except for the path front of him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Two men fought on the other side of the street on top of someone&apos;s car, an old cruddy-looking thing with dents and chipped red paint, while their drunk buddies cheered them on with beer bottles in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When they were twenty feet away from that group, an unshaven man with long filthy hair, dressed in equally unclean and comically oversized clothing, walked toward them along the path they were going, talking to himself loudly. Konrad and Dieter immediately switched to the opposite side of the street, away from the man as he continued arguing with whoever he was talking to. Konrad was certain the man had no earphone, let alone a cellphone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning around another corner of a building, they walked down the block. As they passed another alley, Konrad saw a drunk man urinating against a dumpster, muttering to himself in drunken slurs as he tried to keep his balance. In another alley, a group of kids were smashing an old rusted car, treating the vandalism like some sort of game.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Two hooded figures huddled together, then broke away quickly, one of them having taken something from the other&apos;s hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;No matter where Konrad looked, there was always something going on.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;One particularly uncomfortable moment occurred when after the duo turned down another corner that a group of hooded figures, four teenagers, started to follow after them. The men walked calmly, slowly increasing their pace, only to find that the group did the same. After ten more steps, Dieter whirled around with his sidearm drawn, a black eight-millimeter Beretta, his face hard and filled with hate, ready to kill.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The teenagers stopped upon seeing the gun pointed at them. In their hands, switchblades wavered. Their eyes wide like saucers, they stared uneasily at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Give me a reason,&quot; Dieter said in an icy tone, then gestured to a sewer behind the group. &quot;Dump the knives into that sewer. Slowly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The hooded figures turned around and obeyed. One figure, apparently the brains of this ragtag group of shitheads, however, wasn&apos;t so easily discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You too, kid.&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come on, man!&quot; the punk&apos;s friends pled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you gonna do about it?&quot; he huffed brazenly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He suddenly lunged forward with the knife in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter fired, causing the figure to cry out in pain as he dropped the knife and held his bloody hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;My hand!&quot; the youth cried. &quot;Fuck! My hand!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kicking the knife quickly into the sewer, Dieter grabbed the youth by the collar and slammed him up against the wall, pressing the weapon under his chin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What did I say?! What did I just say, you stupid fucking cunt!&quot; Dieter roared, his teeth bared. &quot;&lt;em&gt;What did I say&lt;/em&gt;?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry!&quot; the figure wept. &quot;I&apos;m sorry. Please! Please, don&apos;t hurt me! I&apos;ll do anything! I&apos;ll do <text:soft-page-break/>anything, I promise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;L-look, dude, we don&apos;t want any trouble,&quot; one of the teenagers said. &quot;We&apos;ll give you money, just-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shut up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The figure stood there in stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here&apos;s what you little fuckheads are going to do,&quot; the bodyguard said lowly. &quot;You and your buddy are going to take a long walk back to whatever shitty little hole you&apos;re from. I am going to count to five, and if you little shits aren&apos;t out of my sight by the time I finish, I&apos;m going to start taking shots at you like I&apos;m at the carnival. Do you understand?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The youth swallowed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; he answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; Dieter replied as he shoved the thug he was holding over to them. &quot;Now fuck off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The teenagers bolted, running even faster the moment he started counting. Once they were completely out of sight, he stopped.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We should get out of here,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;the cops will arrive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;They won&apos;t,&quot; Dieter said. &quot;Like I said before, the cops tend to turn a blind eye to stuff that happens around here. As long as you pay them, anyway.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What about those thugs? I&apos;m sure no gang member is going to turn a blind eye to one of their own getting hurt. What if they come back with more?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter laughed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Gang members&apos;? Those asswipes?&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;Did you see their clothes? They&apos;re not part of any gang, just stupid little faggots playing gangster.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do you know?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Believe me, I know,&quot; Dieter said ominously as he glanced at his watch. &quot;We&apos;re behind schedule. Come on, &quot;Newton&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The place where they were expected to meet up at was a crappy-looking bar.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dimly lit, the bar was Spartan in its furnishings, with a bar counter at the center, a few tables, chairs, a pool table at the back, a radio that played heavy rock and a couple of old arcade machines, but it looked very unfinished and reeked of urine and cigarette smoke, the air practically thick with the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bar had no sense of style, let alone warmth, like the rest of this godforsaken neighborhood. Konrad was certain that he saw bullet holes on some of the walls. The floor and most of the barstools next to the counter were stained, with what Konrad didn&apos;t even want to know, let alone think about.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It was practically empty.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Aside from some rats and cockroaches the size of terriers, the only ones there were the bartender, a gruff bald man of forty with hairy tattooed arms and a handlebar mustache, his assistant, a scrawny twenty year-old fellow with the face of a rat with a ring between his nostrils like a bull, and a man sitting alone at a table at the back left-hand corner of the bar next to the pool table.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The latter stood out like a sore thumb from this entire neighborhood. Dressed in a black leather jacket, a white shirt, blue jeans and a pair of black combat boots, the man was in his early thirties, had a lean but muscular build, weighing, if Konrad were to guess, a hundred and ninety-five pounds. Clean-shaven, with a blonde crew cut and tanned skin devoid entirely of tattoos and piercings, the man was strikingly handsome, much to Konrad&apos;s envy, with chiseled features, a straight nose, a strong jaw and chin, and piercing crystal clear blue eyes. Everything about him - his cleanliness, the tidy and pristine condition of his clothing, and his build - suggested he was military, if not former military. At a glance, it would be easy to see the man as an anomaly in this crude setting - hell, compared to the rest of the inhabitants around here the guy looked like Apollo, - but there was a noticeably dangerous edge that Konrad was able to sense from him, along with his arrogance; the man had a perpetual smirk plastered on one side of his mouth with a look of <text:soft-page-break/>contempt for everyone and everything around him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Dieter approached him, the man stood up. Konrad estimated him to be six-two.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ben,&quot; Dieter greeted, tipping his hat.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter,&quot; the man said in a lazy Californian accent as he eyed Konrad suspiciously. &quot;You didn&apos;t say anything about bringing friends along. Who&apos;s Emperor Palpatine here?&quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;This is an associate mine,&quot; the bodyguard said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m Newton,&quot; Konrad said as he held out his gloved hand to shake hands.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The man didn&apos;t reach out. Instead he just stared at him, the damn smirk creeping back up to one side of his face.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course you are,&quot; he replied as his eyes studied his apparel. &quot;The fuck is with the get up? You look like some sort of flasher.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s temper flared. In just under five seconds the man had already gotten under his skin. Konrad took a step when Dieter clapped his hand on his shoulder, giving him a look. He then turned back to the man.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;My friend had suffered some serious burns recently,&quot; Dieter explained.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hm,&quot; came the response.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad didn&apos;t know if the man had bought it, and frankly he didn&apos;t really care.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn&apos;t get your name,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never told you,&quot; the man replied evenly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gentlemen, please, there&apos;s no need for hostilities,&quot; Dieter said. &quot;Newton, meet Ben Ferris, ex-Special Forces Lieutenant. Ben, Newton. Everybody knows everybody now, alright? Okay. Now, we should sit down, we have business to discuss.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The men sat down at the table. Konrad watched as the bartender and his assistant stepped away from the bar counter and moved to the back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re late,&quot; Ferris said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were briefly detained by some thugs, but a little ass-kicking or two I find is enough to send the message home,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Usually does,&quot; Ferris nodded in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re not going to pat us down?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why? Do you want me to?&quot; Ferris asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, I just thought you would to check for concealed firearms.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t bother with that,&quot; he replied. Again, the damn smirk. &quot;Besides, I like a good fight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It does work up an appetite, though,&quot; Dieter said. &quot;You want to order something?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris raised an eyebrow.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re not serious, right?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re not eating?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris gave him an incredulous look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you kidding? In this stinkin&apos; dump? I wouldn&apos;t eat the food here even if you paid me &lt;em&gt;billions! &lt;/em&gt;You&apos;d get botulism from this shit,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;The beer&apos;s safe, though. It&apos;s in a sealed cooler behind the counter. Speaking of which, I might as well get one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He got up from his seat and headed toward the bar counter at the right.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yo, Boris!&quot; Ferris called to the back. &quot;Mind if I take a beer?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The man said something garbled in Russian.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I love you too, Boris baby!&quot; he said sarcastically, making an audible and highly exaggerated smooching sound.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Coming back with beer in hand, Konrad watched as Ferris pulled the cap off and took a swig of his drink.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh, that hit the spot,&quot; he said after swallowing. &quot;You two want a beer?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Both men declined his offer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh well,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Sitting back down into his chair, he regarded the two men before him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So tell me, Dieter, how&apos;s life been treating you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m doing pretty well,&quot; Dieter replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Still a bodyguard?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yep.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hear that you&apos;re working for royalty.

I could tell you all sorts of juicy details - that is, if you&apos;re willing to pay me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nothing that Ferris said comforted Konrad. It made him realize how precarious their situation was.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re leaving,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He started to get out of his chair when Ferris stood up in protest.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey, hey, hey!

If the people that you stole from tricked you into giving us a fake, they&apos;re not just pulling one over on us, but on &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; as well. How do you think you being made a dupe of is going to look to others in your line of business?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And who the fuck is gonna gab?!&quot; Ferris said threateningly in a raised voice.

Then he glanced up.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me tell you something, Dieter,&quot; he said in a hushed voice, as if trying to restrain the full fiery blast of his rage. &quot;You&apos;ll never, NEVER, find anyone as good as me, and when I say that the job was a success, you better not fuckin&apos; question it! This shitty little job you gave me was &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; compared to all the others I had before. I did the job, I succeeded, and my record remains intact.

As minutes counted, Konrad decided to break the awkward silence.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to examine the items,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Reaching to the chair beside him, Ferris brought up a couple of rolled up parchment scrolls that were old with age along with a medallion and a miniature bust, both depicting stylized <text:soft-page-break/>interpretations of a tiger. Pulling his hands away, he watched Konrad as he reached out to grab them. The moment his fingers touched the artifacts, Konrad felt something, something electrical.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Yes, they&apos;re real,&lt;/em&gt;&apos; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;There was power in these artifacts, he was certain. He could feel it surging through them.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad did a double-take.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Where in the world did that thought come from? Was he losing his mind already?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Trying to push his worries down, Konrad unravelled the parchment and studied it, carefully examining every line and detail before moving on to the others. After two minutes, he glanced up and gave a nod.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re real,&quot; he confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Told you,&quot; Ferris replied, although there was a subtle hint of relief.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Were there any complications?&quot; Dieter asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The smirk returned.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; Ferris said smugly, &quot;I may have cracked a few eggs here and there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You sent several men to the hospital,&quot; Konrad growled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about,&quot; Ferris said innocently, then added, &quot;but even if I did, so what?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;So what&quot;?!&quot; Konrad roared. &quot;It was in the news! What part of &lt;em&gt;&quot;discretion&quot;&lt;/em&gt; didn&apos;t you understand?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris gave him a dark look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t like your tone, &lt;em&gt;Newton&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; he said lowly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And I don&apos;t like fuckups, especially ones that result in &lt;em&gt;media coverage&lt;/em&gt; and with &lt;em&gt;Tibetan monks being beaten and sent to hospital!&quot; &lt;/em&gt;Konrad fired back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ha! &lt;em&gt;Tibetan monks!&quot; &lt;/em&gt;Ferris barked with a sneer. &quot;Last I heard on the news they were being dismissed as &quot;Tiger cultists&quot; and that the Dalai Lama supposedly denied having any involvement or affiliation with them. For a group that&apos;s supposed to be about pacifism, they sure put up one hell of a fight, especially that last guy before I clocked him out. He was a nut.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He tilted his head thoughtfully. &quot;I guess things being the way they are in Tibet and China has made people from the former take more stock of their potential value, especially with the latter country coming down on them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh well,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared at the man in repulsion.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do you live with yourself?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris scowled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you, my mother? Your problem is that you&apos;re a pussy that gets squeamish at the sight of a little blood. Conflict makes the world go round, man; without it we wouldn&apos;t have our stereos, our TVs, our education, our governments, our way of life...and there&apos;s plenty of money to be made from it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He swung his boots onto the table, leaning casually against the cushion.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The way I see it, I&apos;m merely doing the world a service,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether it&apos;s overthrowing governments or helping governments find those that shit the bed, guys like me &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt; someone out there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh really?&quot; Konrad said sarcastically.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Damn straight,&quot; Ferris said. &quot;Face it, in order to maintain the illusion of being&lt;em&gt; incapable&lt;/em&gt; of doing no wrong or having done no wrong, you need someone to do things you couldn&apos;t. Otherwise, how would you be able to sleep at night? Have you ever thought about the people that had made the clothes on your back? The same people who probably got hurt or ripped off? Do you shudder every time you use a cellphone to make a call?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What does my cellphone have to do with this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Plenty. I can tell you about how it was made in some factory in India with child labor. I could <text:soft-page-break/>even tell you about how those children were butchered, maimed or worse, unable to live anywhere except some shithole. Do you ever think about that every time you use a computer, text a buddy, write an email and so on? No. You may cry when you occasionally hear about it, but other than that, it&apos;s pushed to the back of your mind. Intentional, unintentional. Care, don&apos;t care. Do something, do nothing. Cause, effect, side-effect, whatever - the point is, people are going to get hurt no matter what, when, where, who, why or how, that&apos;s just life. Besides...&quot; he paused as he drank from his beer bottle. Putting it down onto the table, he continued, smiling, &quot;I love my job.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The smile faded from his face.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, if you&apos;re done being a bleeding heart, what about my payment?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter took out his cellphone. After a few minutes, he placed the phone away.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Money&apos;s been wired to your Geneva account, as promised.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris took out his own cell phone from his own pant pocket. Satisfied, he gave a nod of approval.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And that concludes our business,&quot; Konrad said as he gathered up the artifacts and put them into his pockets. Turning to his companion, he gave him a nod. &quot;Let&apos;s go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Getting up from their seats, the two men turned around and started for the exit.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad was surprised to see how quiet and empty the streets had become. It hadn&apos;t been that long since he and Dieter came into the area, and yet in the span of a few minutes, all activity had ceased the moment they exited the bar. As he and his bodyguard retraced their way back, Konrad anxiously watched the empty streets. The only sounds he heard were wind and thunder from the approaching storm. The only activity he saw was the fluttering of a piece of cardboard. Konrad felt exposed in the empty streets due to its openness and silence. Even more, he was certain that he and Dieter were being watched and followed. Dieter also seemed aware of it himself, for despite the broad brimmed felt hat concealing most of his face in shadow, Konrad could see the man&apos;s mouth drawn into a tight grim line. He was also getting noticeably jumpier, his hand ready to reach for his sidearm at the slightest disturbance in a moment&apos;s notice.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;They were close to the entrance when a clattering of garbage cans from their right caused Dieter to whip out his Beretta. A loud meow caused the man to give a sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fucking cats,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Rounding a corner, Konrad saw the familiar glow of the neon lights when a punch to the eye caught him by surprise, causing him to stagger back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir!&quot; Dieter shouted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad heard a scuffle, a gunshot, a grunt and a clatter on the ground, followed by the sound of someone being hit, a groan of pain and a thud. As he regained his balance, Konrad looked up to see Ferris stepping out from the shadows, standing over Dieter with a sneer on his face.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did you think that I was just going to let you go after that little stunt ya pulled, D?&quot; Ferris asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He kicked Dieter in the ribs, causing him to cry out in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You think you could just humiliate me like that in front of my associates?!&quot; he said before kicking him again.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Leave him alone!&quot; Konrad yelled as he charged forward.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dodging his attack to the side, Ferris backhanded him, causing him to stagger back in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fuck off, gimp,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad whirled around in rage, lunging again at the man with hands outstretched, lashing out in every direction he moved. Ferris effortlessly ducked, danced, rolled and glided through the swipes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ha! You fight like a bitch!&quot; the man sneered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad charged him again, his face heated beneath his scarf. When he stepped forward to throw a punch, Ferris somersault kicked into the air, the blow catching Konrad in the jaw, lifting him off his feet and causing him to crash onto the ground and see stars.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Rolling over, he stumbled onto all fours when he felt a blow to the chest, causing him to double over, followed by another, and another and another. Ferris was circling around him, laughing at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fuckin&apos; faggot! You thought you could take me on?! ME?! Really?!&quot; he said loudly, spitting on him. &quot;Stupid motherfucker. You can&apos;t fight for shit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad struggled onto his hands and knees when he felt the mercenary grab his hood.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let&apos;s see what you look like,&quot; Ferris said as he pulled the hood back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As the hood was whisked away, Ferris stared, startled and perplexed by what he saw.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;No sooner had those words left his mouth when the cloaked figure gave a roar of fury as it lunged at him, knocking him down onto his back. The cloaked figure pummeled at him repeatedly, slamming his fists against his face like an angry gorilla over and over.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad continued slamming his fists down on Ferris, his entire consciousness consumed by nothing but rage and hate. He would have continued had Dieter not intervened by pulling him away from the figure beneath him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;STOP IT! STOP IT! SIR, GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF!&quot; Dieter said through clenched teeth as he clutched tightly around his torso.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad struggled against him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir, for god&apos;s sake, stop! Breathe through your nostrils. Just breathe, Baron!&quot; Dieter said in a hushed voice. &quot;Breathe in, breathe out. Slow breaths.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad closed his eyes and followed the bodyguard&apos;s instructions. After three minutes, his body relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You okay?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once was he satisfied that Konrad regained self-control, he let go.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good. Get your hood back up, sir.&quot; Dieter replied as he went over to Ferris&apos; fallen form, his felt hat in hand. Konrad paled as he saw the damage done. Ferris&apos; face was swollen, his eyes black and blue while blood oozed from his nose.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is he dead?&quot; Konrad asked worriedly as he tidied himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard shook his head as put his felt hat back on.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, he&apos;s still breathing,&quot; he assured. &quot;Barely conscious.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A slight groan came from Ferris&apos; cut lips as he dazedly looked up at Dieter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pulling out a pair of handcuffs from his coat, Dieter clapped one manacle around the semi-conscious man&apos;s wrist, then after rolling him onto his side, bound both hands behind his back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since when do you carry around handcuffs?&quot; Konrad demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a present from an old girlfriend that was into kinky shit,&quot; the bodyguard explained. &quot;Call the car.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad pulled out his cellphone and dialed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Heinrich, get your ass here this instant!&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ll send you the address to pick us up at.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jawohl!&quot; Came the reply.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once he finished texting the address of the street they were on, Konrad hung up turned back to Dieter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Car&apos;s on its way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are we going to do with him?&quot; Dieter asked, gesturing to Ferris.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ll take him with us. He&apos;s seen me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter gave him a dark look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re kidnapping people now?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We don&apos;t have a choice, Dieter.

He hadn&apos;t thought this through. &quot;I don&apos;t know. I need to think.

Who is that?&quot; Heinrich asked as they approached the car with Ferris in hand, dragging his feet along the ground as they carried him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Never mind that. Open your trunk.&quot; Konrad demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Exchanging nervous glances with the others in the backseat, Heinrich looked to Dieter for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do as I say!&quot; Konrad said harshly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Flinching, the driver obeyed, popping the trunk open. Dragging Ferris to the back of the limo, they pulled up the lid and hoisted the man in before sealing it shut, slamming it down hard to make sure it was secure.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you still have the artifacts, Baron?&quot; Dieter asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Checking his cloak, Konrad felt around in the pockets before finally grabbing hold of said-items.

I don&apos;t want some homeless person or kid to-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got it.&quot; Dieter interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; Konrad said as he gave one final glance around. The winds were picking up and it was starting to rain. The storm was close. &quot;Let&apos;s get out of here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The drive back was tense as the other men in the limo silently stared at Konrad and Dieter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Rain pelted loudly against the vehicle like millions of fingers tapping on a table while the wind whistled. Even through the tinted windows Konrad could see how dark it was getting outside. It was at that moment he heard the siren behind them along with a pair of flashing lights.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shit,&quot; Heinrich said as he slowed and pulled over.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s heart raced as he saw the silhouettes of two police officers head over to the driver&apos;s side.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Heinrich rolled down his window, Konrad caught sight of one of the men. Dressed in a blue retro-styled overcoat modeled after the American police uniforms of the 1910s and 1920s, with a balaclava covering most of his head except for his face, the man wore a peaked cap and had a harsh face with a strong aquiline nose.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Guten Abend, Officer,&quot; Heinrich greeted. &quot;Is there a problem?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You were speeding,&quot; the officer replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah hell.&quot; the driver swore.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;License and registration please.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Heinrich reached for his wallet, Konrad heard a groan.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The sound caught everyone&apos;s attention.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What was that?&quot; the officer said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot; Ferris shouted from the trunk.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s someone in the trunk.&quot; Konrad heard a voice say to the police officer. Probably his partner.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know who it is,&quot; the officer replied with a dark look on his face.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Help me!

Shaking himself furiously, he wiped himself off with the towel, then got on a pair of shorts and gave a heavy, weary and sad sigh as he headed out the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s about time you showed up, Herr Baron. I was afraid that we&apos;d have to cancel our appointment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sorry,&quot; Konrad said as Jurgen wheeled him into her office.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Sitting behind her desk, Dr. Erin Gupte was an intimidating, stoic, fifty-three year woman with short silver hair, strong features and a stern mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Dressed in a lab coat, a white buttoned up blazer, blouse and a long black skirt with heels, she exuded confidence and a sense of authority, taking Konrad aback despite her much smaller frame and stature.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He was reminded of a principal he had years ago; the woman looked and sounded as if she had been carefully constructed from ice, with a low grating voice and a cold demeanor to match.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Her office was small, probably no more than eight feet long and five or six feet wide, with two bookshelves lined against the walls and her desk positioned between them both, while mounted prominently on the wall behind her in display were various graduate certificates and awards from prestigious universities. He didn&apos;t see any photos.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t appreciate having my time wasted.&quot; she said as she stood up. &quot;Follow me to the examination room please.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen obeyed, steering Konrad after her as they passed by various closed doors with labels indicating the other labs and storage spaces. One door in particular was regarded with dread by the Baron - the door to the dungeon. Ever since that day, he tried avoiding that place whenever he could, for he knew that one day he might end up there, just as his father had before him. It always came back to haunt him, be it in dreams or when he was awake.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once they arrived, they slipped inside and locked the door behind them. Gupte&apos;s attention was fixed on the file she had in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Get him onto the table.&quot; she said without looking up.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen reached down when Konrad got up from the chair himself and sat on the examination table.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Remove your hood and coat, Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As he did so, Konrad felt ashamed. When Gupte looked up at him, she paused momentarily, then resumed her examination in a detached clinical manner, checking his pulse, eyes, mouth, teeth, breathing, hands, etc. When she touched parts of his chest he flinched.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some bruising here on and near your eye,&quot; she noted. &quot;Been in a fight, I take it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen looked at Konrad expectantly for an explanation. He didn&apos;t bother answering. Continuing on dispassionately with the examination, Gupte gave no indications of disgust, fear, wonder, or intrigue. Nothing. She was like a machine in human skin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once she finished, she stepped back, making notes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll have to admit, your case is interesting,&quot; she said casually.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it something that can be treated with gene therapy?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Too early to tell,&quot; she said as she went over to a cabinet, taking out a syringe. &quot;I&apos;ll need to take some samples from you in order to get a better understanding of your condition before I can prescribe a suitable treatment plan.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad growled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hate needles,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh don&apos;t be such a baby, Herr Baron,&quot; Gupte said as she approached him with syringe in hand. &quot;It&apos;ll only take a moment.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad sat alone at the long dining room table, rubbing his sore arm as he waited for his dinner, his hood pulled down.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen appeared with a plate covered by a steel cloche. Placing it down in front of Konrad, he pulled the steel covering away to reveal his supper - maple salmon with asparagus, cut-up carrots and celery.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad growled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Again!&quot; he said in exasperation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s healthy for you, Herr Baron,&quot; Jurgen replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it too much to ask for a steak?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not with your weight.

I have something special planned for this final episode tonight at nine o&apos;clock.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen sighed, shaking his head wearily.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You just don&apos;t let things go, do you?&quot; he said. &quot;To be honest with you, Herr Baron, I think you would be better off just having the show cancelled.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why?&quot; Konrad demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well what is the point of having it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I could say the same thing about various other shows, including those featuring such intellectual giants as &quot;Snooki&quot;!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron. Be straight with me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad exhaled through his nostrils, setting his fork down with a clatter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a time, Jurgen, when I used to be in the ring,&quot; he said. &quot;There was a time when people - men, women and children, - used to know and cheer my name and made me feel like I was a hero, like I was capable of taking on the world itself. Like I was unbreakable. Free. There was a time when I had lived for nothing else but the fight itself, and I loved every moment of it. I can&apos;t do any of that anymore. You don&apos;t know what I would give just to be in the ring again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen gave him a pitying look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe it&apos;s for the best that you couldn&apos;t, Herr Baron. Not everything lasts forever.&quot; the servant said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad harrumphed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s the problem, Jurgen,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He sat quietly for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were also other reasons why I want to do this, Jurgen. Why I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to do this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want to be viewed as legitimate, Jurgen. I want the tournament to have that same level of success and prestige that other martial arts programs have and enjoy.

There is no point for me in renewing the trademark. It&apos;s not like I&apos;d be able to participate anyway. Not like this. I&apos;ll call David after the show&apos;s over and let him know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He resumed eating quietly as Jurgen stood beside him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Once he finished, Konrad sat in his private den upstairs, the fireplace crackling away as he tested the strings of his stadivarius violin with his bow, making sure it was properly tuned, turning the pegs when he felt that a wire was too loose.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Somewhere outside, a wolf howled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Crows cawed loudly and bats squeaked as the wind whistled against the castle walls, causing window shutters outside to rock loudly from their frames.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once he was satisfied, he positioned the violin on his left shoulder, his elbow under the instrument&apos;s center. With his bow, Konrad repeated a note several times before finally moving onto the rest of the melody as the various sounds outside joined him in symphony.* He was lost in the music when the door opened, startling him. He calmed down upon recognizing Dieter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter, for fuck&apos;s sake!&quot; Konrad hissed. &quot;Don&apos;t you know how to knock?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sorry.&quot; the bodyguard said as he eyed the instrument in his hand. &quot;I just heard the music and wondered who was playing. I didn&apos;t expect it to be you, Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad grunted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t be so surprised, Dieter.&quot; the aristocrat said. &quot;There was a time, you know, when I had wanted to be a musician and a songwriter.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; Dieter asked with interest.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh yes. It was a schoolboy fancy. I wanted to be a lot of things growing up. I dabbled in drawing, painting, sculpting, swimming, sailing, the violin.

After three minutes of playing, he finished.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s good,&quot; he said. &quot;What is it called?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&apos;Zahn und Klaue&apos;,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad said. &quot;It&apos;s a work in progress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think I detect a slight element of Camille Saint-Saens&apos; &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; with Bach&apos;s &quot;Toccata and Fugue in D Minor?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah!

We got confused why we heard noises every time we done slammed it into our faces. Bob fig&apos;red that it was jus&apos; the cat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat laughed heartily, a harsh sound to most except those familiar and used to him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amused?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very.&quot; he replied as he wiped his eyes and settled back down.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s the occasion for doing it now?&quot; Dieter asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I read an article in a newspaper about how creativity and exercising different parts of the brain by doing different activities can help fend off dementia and Alzheimer&apos;s.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But you don&apos;t have either, Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; Konrad admitted, &quot;but it&apos;s close. Worse, in my opinion. Sometimes I forget things, Dieter, and I worry that I do things without ever realizing it. So, I&apos;ve been practicing.

Part of his face, his forehead, one section of his eye and cheek, also had red paint on it, but no matter how hard he looked, Konrad was never able to get a sense of what the markings meant or were supposed to represent. He wondered if it was something specific and symbolic to the young man and his tribe or if it was just a fancy design that he came up with on his own.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Eagle first appeared on the scene in 2012, a highly intelligent, charismatic personality with a wonderful sense of theatricality, a strong flair for the dramatic and humor that made him a favorite among audiences.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;This popularity, however, had proved especially troublesome; by using it as a platform, Eagle rallied against Ultratech in interviews and on social media, bringing to light the embarrassing fact that one of their factories in the Idaho region was repeatedly fined for polluting the native lands.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Board Members wanted to get rid of him due to the fact that he was turning public opinion against the company, but Konrad, being the majority shareholder, denied their vote.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;For one, Eagle was a very popular figure, one of the most popular the tournament has had in ages - removing him would be disastrous for the company and for ratings, and every bit of currency mattered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Second, Konrad had liked the young Native American; in a lot of ways, he had reminded the Baron of himself when he was younger.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The main reason, however, unknown to the rest of the Board Members themselves, was that at the time Konrad had a use for Eagle; apparently he had an older brother of some influence, a &quot;tooat&quot; or medicine man, if those were even the proper words for it in the Nez Perce and English languages.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, due to schedules and the worsening of his condition, he hadn&apos;t been able to get into contact with the young Native American, let alone his elder sibling. If he were to persuade them both into offering him some insight about the weyekin or &quot;spirit guide&quot;, if not a way to cure him of his dreadful malady, then maybe...&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Maybe...&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad heaved a heavy sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;What the hell was he thinking?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Why does he keep doing this to himself?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad felt ashamed of himself; the idea of extorting a people victimized by one of his own companies&apos; factories was repugnant.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As he watched the young Native American smiling, waving at the audiences, talking and laughing with the interviewers, Konrad felt his stomach churn.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; getting worse, and it nearly cost him his soul.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen was right about everything.

For a moment, it almost seemed as if the fighter was staring &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; at him, which was impossible due to the one-way mirror.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stand by in case we&apos;re in need of medical assistance,&quot; he called into the radio.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jawohl.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The figure stood there for a long time, staring in his direction. The more Konrad stared back, the more unsettled he became.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Something was off.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Carnegie lurched out from the shadows, Konrad did a double-take as the man stopped just outside the alley entrance.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jesus,&quot; Roger breathed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Bare-chested with an armband on his right arm and military fatigue-styled pants with huge combat boots, Carnegie was a hulking brute of a man with the body of a thickly muscled bear that stood at six-eight. Bald with a broken nose, his face reminded Konrad of a tiger&apos;s. On his chest was a Celtic-styled cross tattoo with intricate lines, a recurring motif that ringed around both the man&apos;s eyes and was displayed prominently on his back. As far as fighters were concerned, Carnegie may not have been the brightest of individuals, but as far as appearances were concerned, he was one of the most intimidating looking with a ferocity to match.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;But the Carnegie that Konrad saw now was different. He still looked like the same fellow, but his skin was sickly pale and yellow. Even more, he had a strange glassy stare, a stare that was completely at odds with the fiery personality Carnegie was known to have.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the hell happened to him?&quot; Roger asked. &quot;Do you think he is sick?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Before Konrad could answer, his cellphone went off. Checking the call display, he blinked as he saw Dieter&apos;s name.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes?&quot; he answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron, it&apos;s Dieter.&quot; Konrad was put off by the alarm in his voice. In the background, he heard someone retching violently.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s wrong?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s Carnegie! Lawrence and I found his manager dead in the shower.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;WHAT?!&quot; he yelled into the phone, causing Roger and Michael to look up startled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;He killed him, Baron!

Looking straight ahead to Eagle, Konrad watched as the Irish fighter pulled his lips back into a hideous grin that made him flinch in disgust. It was at that moment that the death metal-styled tune was abruptly cut off completely; in its place was a bagpipe that played two long notes repeatedly. By the ninth note, Carnegie started to slowly walk towards Eagle, saying something, but it was impossible to tell what was being said. Konrad&apos;s ear twitched.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Listen.&quot; he said in a hushed tone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Roger and Michael gave him a curious look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shh!&quot; He interrupted, tilting his head in concentration. Both bodyguards unconsciously followed suite.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It was barely even audible, but they heard it just the same.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Whispering. Or rather, quiet chanting that repeated the second verse repeatedly, then repeated the previous verse again at slightly louder volumes, building more and more each time. Konrad heard a strange wailing noise in the background. At first he thought that it was wind, but as the chanting continued building up, the more dread weighed down upon Konrad. He felt physically ill the more he listened. He was certain that they were screams. Screams of fear, screams of agony, screams of rage, screams of insanity, screams of laughter. Nonstop crying. Men, women, children. <text:soft-page-break/>Voices of the damned. It was as if someone had decided to place a microphone by the gates of Hell and record the awful racket that went on down below. Konrad raised the radio.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Felix, what the hell is going on?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Who&apos;s doing that? Why is the broadcast still on?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I-I don&apos;t know, Baron!&quot; Felix answered bewilderedly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you mean you don&apos;t know?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The equipment isn&apos;t responding!

It&apos;s running on its own!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;BULLSHIT!&quot; Konrad said angrily. &quot;Quit fucking around now or I swear to God that I&apos;ll find someone better to replace you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And I swear to God, Baron, this is beyond us! We&apos;ve have nothing to do with this!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you contacted the police yet?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can&apos;t, the lines are dead!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you think someone could have hacked the network?&quot; Michael asked quietly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Impossible.&quot; he answered. &quot;Felix, I want you to listen close-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He was cut off as the chanting quadrupled in its intensity, startling everyone, causing several including members of the audience and Michael to cry out in alarm and the Baron to jump in his wheelchair, nearly dropping the walkie-talkie. Recovering quickly from the shock, Konrad raised it up again to his face.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Felix,&quot; he said, but stopped. &quot;Felix?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The chanting was playing from the radio speaker. Shutting it off, Konrad took out his cellphone from his pant pocket and turned it on, only to be met with more of the chanting.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The screaming or wailing, whatever it was, was gone, but the chanting continued, louder than ever, this time accompanied by the beating of a drum. Konrad was able to hear the lyrics clearly this time along with the chorus of voices that chanted it, deep, dreadful-sounding things that didn&apos;t even sound remotely human.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Kung och furste.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Krigare,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kejsare,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Härskar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kropp av ben,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inget hjärta,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Döpt i blod.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Själlös, livlös.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kropp av ben,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inget hjärta,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Döpt i blod.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Själlös, livlös.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It came from every direction at once, even from directly &lt;em&gt;behind&lt;/em&gt; the three men in their private booth.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Stiffening, neither Konrad nor his bodyguards looked to see who or &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; was chanting in the suite behind them - they kept their eyes squarely on the arena, staring straight ahead to avoid seeing the owners of those horrible voices.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Roger&apos;s hand was shakily reaching for his sidearm.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking over to the commentators, Konrad saw both men white as ghosts, tense and perplexed by the bizarre music. The audiences were still, almost entranced by the tune. Staring at the massive cluster, Konrad thought that he caught glimpses of something amongst them, but it was just shadows.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;At least, he hoped they were.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Glancing back to Carnegie, the more Konrad watched the Irish fighter speak, the more certain he became that the lyrics matched his mouth movements.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Carnegie started walking toward Eagle, who backed away cautiously with each step the Irish fighter made. Security personnel stormed into the arena from the fighters&apos; alley behind Carnegie and <text:soft-page-break/>called out to him, causing him to pause and hang his head forward, the chanting stopping the moment he had. Something dropped beside his left foot.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s that?&quot; Michael asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;At first, Konrad thought that it was some sort of misshapen snail, a scrunched up bun or a slice of crumpled up pizza that was thrown at the stage by some disgruntled audience member, but as he glanced back to Carnegie, Konrad realized his mistake. It was an ear. Raising his head back up, Carnegie resumed walking towards Eagle, chanting, his lips pulling back into that disgusting, rictus-like smile as he did so. The chanting renewed throughout the arena.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Kung och furste,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Krigare,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Kejsare,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Härskare.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Kropp av ben,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Inget hjärta,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Döpt i blod,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Själlös, livlös.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As he came closer, a new verse was chanted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Ond Demon,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Folkets hjälte,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Hemlös Gud.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the bagpipe ceased. A drum boomed and a kangling sounded. Carnegie stopped and made a horrible noise, a long, loud inhalation or gasp that both signalled his last breath and the beginning of something. Konrad watched as the horror unfolded before him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;MEIN GOTT!&quot; he cried.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The disembodied chants repeated one word over and over throughout, accompanied by a percussive instrument, possibly a xylophone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flå&lt;/strong&gt;! &lt;strong&gt;flå&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flå&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Maggots were starting to crawl out from the man&apos;s skin and smiling mouth while pieces of his flesh were falling to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Rolling his eyes into the back of his head, Carnegie violently convulsed as he took a shaky step forward, his eyeballs dropping out from their sockets onto the piles of offal that gathered by his feet as he gagged and coughed up nonstop streams of worms, struggling to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;People were screaming.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The security personnel turned away, vomiting, prompting other people to join in. Poor Roger was among those as he retched onto the personal booth&apos;s carpets, burning Konrad&apos;s nostrils and stinking up the air with bile. It took enormous willpower not to join in. Pieces turned into handfuls. Handfuls turned into chunks. The next thing Konrad knew, Carnegie burst into green flame, causing people to scream even louder as the pile beneath ignited with him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Scrambling for his radio, Konrad flicked through the channels frantically.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;FELIX?! ARE YOU THERE? SOMEONE?! ANYONE?! PLEASE! SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER!&quot; he yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As he watched Carnegie&apos;s body consumed by the blazing green inferno, Konrad saw a massive face peer out from it. A woman shrieked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Four feet long and two feet wide, the face was brown in color. Resembling either an elephant or mammoth skull, it had yellow beady blinking eyes and no mouth - at least, as far as Konrad could tell. Where the mouth and lips should be was a medusan-like beard, a series of two foot long octopus tentacles that waved about in the air. Parts of the head were marked by what looked like runes, although of what origin Konrad was uncertain, while draped around its face were some ropes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Puzzled by this aspect, Konrad wondered why it had those when the flame died down, revealing the true nature of the thing; attached to some piece of driftwood, it was actually a sort of grotesque living shield that hung from the left arm of its owner, a being that was just as hideous, loathsome and abnormal, even more so, for its mere existence was madness.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Standing in Carnegie&apos;s place, held together by no apparent form of sinew or muscle, was a human skeleton with a red bandanna wrapped around its forehead.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A diminutive figure that stood at five-six, it was dressed in a Scottish tartan with a belt around its waist while a pair of buccaneer boots that looked like they were from the late 1700s adorned its feet. Wrapped around its torso were a series of ropes while what looked like old rotted parts of a ship&apos;s mast and steering wheel were stabbed into its right shoulder, with one part swinging around loosely behind each time it moved. Its right arm gauntleted, it held in its free bony hand a large cutlass. Staring out at the stunned audience with red, glowing, lidless balls of light from its sockets, shifting its mandible around, grating its teeth back and forth, the impossible entity regarded its surroundings, then, to Konrad&apos;s amazement and horror, tossed its head back and let out a loud, shrill, defiant maniacal laugh, despite not having any sort musculature, vocals or lungs. It was an awful, insanity-inducing sound that pierced the eardrums and buried itself into peoples&apos; consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Yaahahahahahaha!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the hell is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;?!&quot; Roger exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad raised the radio again and pressed the call button.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Please let it work,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he prayed, then cheered as he got a response.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Richter, are you there?&quot; he said into the radio.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jawohl,&quot; Richter answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Success! The chanting was still there, but at least there&apos;s a signal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Listen to me carefully,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;I want you to use non-lethals only.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look around, Richter! There&apos;s seven thousand people here. We cannot risk that thing getting to them or Eagle, nor can we risk firing a shot without hitting and/or killing them. Before you do so,I want you to try communicating with it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you insane?! It&apos;s a goddamn zombie!&quot; Hermann exclaimed on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you don&apos;t antagonize it in any way, it will not have any reason to lash out.&quot; Konrad reasoned. &quot;Just try to get its attention. Smile and try to be friendly. Show that we mean it no harm. If it attacks, taser it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad heard the man mutter something unintelligible on the radio, then watched as the skeleton took a step toward Eagle, stopping as the security team called to it from behind. Turning around, it tilted its head curiously as one of the men spoke, raising his arms and hands up in a placating motion, smiling, his colleagues nervously following his example. The skeleton stared at them, then glanced back to Eagle, shifting its jaw back and forth, deep in apparent thought. As it lowered the sword, Konrad slowly nodded to himself in assurance.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe it could be reasoned with after all!&quot; Konrad said to his bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The skeleton then turned toward the security team, raised up its cutlass threateningly, then stomped toward them in halting steps.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Wh-REALLY?!&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad yelled at the figure through the one way mirror in disbelief. &quot;You &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; have a one-tract mind?! The only reason why you stopped was because you didn&apos;t know &lt;em&gt;who to kill first&lt;/em&gt;?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It can&apos;t hear you, Baron,&quot; Michael reminded. &quot;At least, I think it can&apos;t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The stupid bastard kept stomping toward the security team, then started to run, laughing menacingly and maniacally, waving its cutlass in the air dangerously as it did so. Once it was well within range, the security personnel fired off their X-26 tasers, the electrodes planting themselves onto parts of its bony body. It shrieked as thousands of volts of electricity coursed into it, then collapsed to the floor in a clutter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;They got it!&quot; Roger yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as the security personnel scrambled quickly to the fallen creature, one of them raising up his boot and slamming it down onto the thing&apos;s skull, crushing it underfoot several times. When he finished, he pulled away and pressed into his radio.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hostile down.&quot; Hermann said. &quot;No more Mister Zombie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Konrad sighed in relief. Changing channels, he raised up the radio.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Felix, are you there?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;No answer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Felix, are you there?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Still no response.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Control room, do you read?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as Hermann went over to the shield, which was still flailing its tentacles about, blinking its eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Felix? Do you read?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;From the other end, a guttural voice spoke, raising hairs on the back of his neck, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;You fool, Felix is dead!&quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared at the radio, taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who is this?!&quot; he demanded. &quot;WHO ARE YOU?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He watched as Hermann raised up his foot and slammed it down on the living shield&apos;s head. The moment his foot made impact, an impossibly huge bony arm made from some sort of green energy erupted from the ground, eliciting shrieks of startled surprise as it scattered debris and held the guard up fifteen feet in the air. The guard screamed and struggled in its grip while the others tried grabbing hold of his legs. The next thing Konrad knew, there came a bright green flash and the guard exploded, raining down blood and gore onto the others as they shielded their eyes from the unexpected downpour. Audiences screamed and, to Konrad&apos;s incredulity, cheered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why the hell are they cheering?!&quot; Konrad asked in confusion. &quot;Can&apos;t they see people are getting&lt;em&gt; killed&lt;/em&gt;?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think &lt;em&gt;they think&lt;/em&gt; this is part of the show,&quot; Michael said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as the skeleton&apos;s frame reconfigured itself in the air, skull and all. From there, it became an all-out slaughter as security guards were eviscerated and decapitated left and right on live television, the ghostly chorus singing obscenely in delight and in accompaniment as if it was some sort of horrible performance. Even worse, the audience seemed to be loving every moment of it, especially when reinforcements arrived in the form of the Theseus combat androids.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Skogen den pratar, boskap på flykt,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Fienden bränner våra marker,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Rasslar med svärd och slår på sköldar,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Redo att dräpa oss nu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Vi ber till dig Spinal, lämna din kropp,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Bli våran hövding, ta till vapen,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Skänk oss din styrka vid denna strid,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Vakna vakna, mäktiga Gud.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;One guard fired his taser only to have the projectiles blocked by the shield as the skeleton stood in a defensive position. As thousands of volts entered the shield, Konrad watched as three green floating spectral skulls appeared behind the demonic figure.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He stopped as the living shield parted its tentacles, blasting into the guard with these ghostly projectiles that exploded against him, chattering and laughing as they curled up in the air before dissipating into nothingness. The guard lay lifeless on the ground, his body a smoking pulped ruin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Mörkret det faller över vårt land,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Vindarna viner, marken skakar,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Fienden samlas runt vårt rike,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Redo att kuva oss nu.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Krigare samlas vid helig grav,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Kallar på Spinal, krigarguden,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Hjälp vi behöver vid denna <text:soft-page-break/>strid,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Fräls oss, fräls oss mäktiga Gud.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Scattered around the entity, the panicking security guards and the Theseus units started firing live rounds at their target.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;CEASE FIRE!&quot; Konrad roared into the radio. &quot; DU VERDAMMTER MORONEN! CAN&apos;T YOU HEAR ME?! I SAID CEASE FIRE!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Bullets pierced the creature&apos;s body, but no matter the direction, part or angle, it just ignored them, continuing relentlessly on in its quest for blood. Its sword glowing with green flame, with a single violent swing, the skeleton cut down several of the Theseus units all at once, leaving them as twisted smoking scrap and wire that clattered to the floor. As one Theseus unit fired point blank into the creature&apos;s ribcage, cutting down one unfortunate guard behind it, another stabbed the skeleton in the back with a retractable wrist blade. Elbowing the machine away, the skeleton brought its cutlass down onto the other&apos;s head, slicing clean through, causing sparks to fly. Planting its boot on the Theseus unit&apos;s chest, the entity pushed it back, wedging its weapon out. The steering wheel on its back creaked and swung as the entity rolled its right shoulder in readiness. As the remaining Theseus units fired upon its position, the skeleton suddenly sunk into a patch of glowing green light in the ground, reappearing instantaneously next to a guard as it killed him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How the hell is it doing that?!&quot; Roger asked as it kept reappearing all over the arena.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ugly little bastard is full of unwanted surprises,&quot; Konrad growled as the entity summoned up a pair of spectral skeletal arms from the ground that somehow phased through each other while at the same time crushing a Theseus unit that was caught in between.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad got out his cellphone and tried calling the police, but the only thing he heard was more of that damn chanting.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Riket det skriker efter vår hjälp,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Spinal han vaknar, lämnar graven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Med kraftigt tjut han samlar trupper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Redo att slåss för oss nu.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad looked to his bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can either of you call the police?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Both men turned on their cellphones.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Vi äter upp svampar för kraft och rus, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Plockar fram yxor, brynjor, hjälmar, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Med Guden Spinals krafter och mod, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Seger, seger, segern är vår.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;GOD! FUCKING! DAMN IT!&quot; Konrad roared as he violently flung his wine glass from the table next to him against the wall.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He helplessly looked back to the arena. The Theseus units had all fallen, scattered around like garbage. The guards were running for their lives, but the bloodthirsty little bastard continued hunting after them, gutting them like animals on the arena floor without mercy. It wouldn&apos;t be long before it turned its attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Roger, take my radio,&quot; Konrad ordered as he held it out to him. &quot;Find Dieter and Lawrence and get down there. Get everyone out of here. Save as many -&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He stopped as he heard the door opened. Turning around in his chair, he saw the aforementioned men, putting the radio back down onto his lap. They were both pale and stained with blood.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter! Lawrence! Where have you been?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter wiped sweat from his forehead.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We were busy tending to the wounded down there. It&apos;s bad, Baron. We&apos;ve tried to do the best we could, but we&apos;ve run out of supplies and the bodies are piling up faster and faster.&quot; he said as he took out a cigarette. His hand was trembling furiously as he lit it. &quot;Where&apos;s the police?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re cut off,&quot; Konrad answered. &quot;Have you sent someone out to get help?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Several ran out the building, but we haven&apos;t heard from them, nor has anyone seen them since.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;What about Eagle?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;SIR, LOOK!&quot; Michael called.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad turned around looked to where he pointed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh mein gott.&quot; Konrad uttered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;To his amazement, Eagle was still down there.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His hands, clothes and face bloody, it looked like he was trying very damn hard to save as many guards as possible, dragging and carrying the injured away to one or both of the fighter alleys, helping those that had fallen up to their feet to flee the scene, even yelling at the audience to get help, call the police or to get out while they still could. At one point it looked like the Native American, a usually affable fellow, was cussing at the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;And who could blame him?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The stupid bastards just sat there, cheering and enjoying the show. The only reaction Eagle got was him getting into an argument with some moron about something. Meanwhile, the skeleton was off to the side. Its sword propped up against a wall, it stood there playing with some guard&apos;s decapitated head, shaking it about with one hand, causing the mouth to flap about obscenely.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;LA LA LA LA LA LA!&quot; it sang off-key happily, trying to get the decapitated head&apos;s mouth to match its awful singing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;After several very hard and violent shakes, the jaw flew right off, causing people to scream.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;One person fainted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Shrugging, it grunted, then absentmindedly tossed the decapitated head over its shoulder, the body part landing onto the bloodied arena floor with a splat. Giving a heavy, sad and discontented sigh, the skeleton picked up its cutlass and reached up its tartan to scratch its bony crotch with its blade, much to the Baron&apos;s disbelief, looking around in boredom before doing a double-take. It now had its beady red orbs fixed on Eagle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Stomping towards him while he was still arguing with some mental midget, it rolled the cutlass eagerly in its hand. It charged toward him with an insane laugh. Eagle was now running furiously around the arena, dodging each of the thing&apos;s attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;RUN! RUN! SCHNELL! SCHNELL!&quot; Konrad shouted furiously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Just right when Eagle headed to one of the fighter alleys, several massive green arms sprouted from the ground, blocking his way out, causing him to skid to a halt. Turning around, he bolted to the other exit, only to find it blocked off by another giant set of arms. He was caged in with no way out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;From the speakers, the chanting repeated only one word, which the audience themselves seemed to delight in saying with it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;SPINAL!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPINAL!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPINAL!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein, nein, NEIN!&quot; Konrad repeated worriedly as he ran his gloved hands against his hooded head. &quot;We have to get him out of there!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How?!&quot; Dieter asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat cupped his hands on his face. If only there was some way to help him. If only there was some way he could get out-&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pausing, he tilted his head thoughtfully, then stood up from his seat, taking hold of the blanket from his lap.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Dieter said in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Wordlessly, Konrad folded up the blanket, then took off his gloves, unsheathing his furry clawed hands. Putting them both onto the seat of the wheelchair, he then slid the cloak, scarf and hood off from his shoulders and head, along with his sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you insane?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, Dieter,&quot; Konrad replied as he neatly folded them and laid them out on his wheelchair, &quot;I&apos;m thinking clearly, very clearly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron, you can&apos;t just go out like that!&quot; Dieter protested.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And why not?

People are going to know it&apos;s you!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not if Michael poses as me.&quot; Konrad said as he pointed to the wheelchair. &quot;What matters now is saving that boy before that thing guts him and the rest of the audience.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what if you get killed?! What if you die from the fall or get cut up to pieces by Skeletor down there?!&quot; Dieter retorted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat paused for a moment and thought about it. It&apos;s true, there was no guarantee that he&apos;d survive.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His shoulders sagged as he sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, then the joke will be on me once again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Eagle stared down at his opponent, his form drawn into a defensive pose, his arms raised in readiness, his fists tightly wound like knots. Beads on sweat rolled down his brow as he met his strange opponent&apos;s unwavering gaze. All around, people were chanting one word, over and over again in conjunction with the chants.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&quot;SPINAL! SPINAL! SPINAL!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning away from Eagle&apos;s eyes, the skeleton glanced at the audiences, tilting its head curiously, moving its jaw. Rolling its shoulder, it took a menacing step in the audience&apos;s direction.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;STAY WHERE YOU ARE!&quot; Eagle shouted, catching the creature&apos;s attention. &quot;Your fight is with me! Just as the Coyote had struck you down ages ago, so too will I, Monster!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The skeleton turned back toward him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His heart beating loudly in his ears, Eagle carefully kept his eye on it, his opponent doing the same. Before either party were able to make a move, the one-way mirror overlooking the arena shattered, raining down glass as something big landed into the arena with them, causing the audiences to cry out in alarm and both fighters to pause. Raising itself up, the creature stood up, staring at the skeleton, growling menacingly. Once it reached its full height, it made several threatening slash gestures, reared itself back and gave a mighty roar, which elicited loud cheers from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;OHHH SHIT!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A WEREWOLF!

DO SOMETHING COOL, DAMN IT! I PAID GOOD MONEY, YOU MORON!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hearing those negative comments, the beast looked in the direction where they had been said, bared its teeth and let out a fearsome roar, eliciting several whoops before turning back to the skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;GET OUT OF THERE!&quot; A voice called from above.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking up to the broken one-way mirror, Eagle saw several men call to him. One of them was in a wheel chair with a cloak and hood.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;GET OUT OF THERE, NOW! RUN!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the hímiinhaama charged toward the skeleton, giving Eagle the chance to flee to the fighter alley.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Putting his hands around the massive green arms, he gave a yell, sharply whisking his hands away from the shock he received. Blowing on his hands, he looked to the dueling creatures.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It seems like there&apos;s only one way to get out, and he knew what he must do.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Charging towards the skeleton, Konrad lashed out with a swipe from his clawed hand, only to have to the attack deflected by that shield.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dodging away in a cartwheel from an oncoming swipe, he slid down to the floor and spun on his back like a top, twisting himself around expertly until his feet connected with the skeleton&apos;s booted feet, causing it to trip.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Launching himself back up to his feet, he lunged at the downed opponent, only to miss as it sank down into the ground in a green flash of light.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He yelped as he felt a hot searing pain across his shoulder blades, causing him to stagger forward. Turning around, he dodged the overhead to the side, twisting, turning, blocking and parrying each of its attacks. Planting a lucky right hook across its jaw, Konrad gave a feral grin and felt a certain degree of satisfaction as he watched the ugly little shit fall down onto its bony ass. Lifting up its head, his opponent narrowed its beady orbs at him, then gave a frustrated, angry roar as it rose and charged him. Leaping high into the air toward him with its cutlass raised over its head, it plunged down. Konrad waited, timing the fall until he back flipped, his feet catching the skeleton in the air, causing it to come crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;OH THAT&apos;S BULLSHIT!&quot; he heard someone from the audience yelled out angrily. &quot;WEREWOLVES DON&apos;T DO BACKFLIPS!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Well this one does! Fuck off, geek!&lt;/em&gt;&apos; Konrad thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Feeling a hot pain across his back again, Konrad stumbled, whimpering before quickly twisting around into a spin, his clawed hands swiping the skeleton across its face and following up with a backhand, then finishing off with another backflip kick.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once it fell the ground, Konrad wasted no time in pinning it to the ground, slamming his fists down upon it over and over again until it sank into the green light, taking Konrad with it. The sensation the aristocrat felt as he traveled into it was unlike anything he had ever experienced; even though it was a scant few seconds, if not less, it felt far longer, a violent process that seemed to span across all of eternity, involving simultaneous tearing and reconstitution of his self. Once he crashed back onto the arena floor, Konrad pushed himself onto his hands and knees, feeling himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;What the hell was that?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hearing the demonic laughter ahead of him, he glanced up to see the creature charging toward him with sword up in the air. Twisting his body to perform a sweep, Konrad&apos;s timing missed its <text:soft-page-break/>mark as the little bastard sank down in front of him, reappearing behind him before ducking down again to avoid Konrad&apos;s side thrust kick. With the creature&apos;s constant teleporting, it became practically impossible to catch the little bastard, leaving him at its mercy as it continued with its hit-and-run tactics, slashing him over and over again until his body was covered in cuts that bled freely. Several cuts were made into his back, his arms, his chest. One caught him on the forehead while another cut into his leg caused Konrad to whine in pain as he collapsed onto the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His body wracked in pain, Konrad breathed heavily as he crawled weakly on his stomach, shutting one eye as blood dripped into it. All around him, the audiences continued to chant that single word, or rather name, over and over again in delirious euphoria.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;SPINAL! SPINAL! SPINAL!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Walking slowly toward him with cracking joints, each step punctuated by loud crunching, &quot;Spinal&quot; spun its cutlass in hand eagerly, eying him. Stopping just a few inches in front of him, it stood directly over him and stared down at Konrad, its skull giving that awful perpetual smile.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;So this is how it ends,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad thought with resignation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Spinal raised up his sword to deliver the finishing blow, Konrad caught sight of a pair of boots bury themselves into the skeleton&apos;s head, driving it off its feet and pushing it further away from him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad squinted under the arena lights as he tried to glance up at the silhouette that saved him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Hímiinhaama!&quot; &lt;/em&gt;A familiar voice said into his ear. &quot;&lt;em&gt;Himiinhaama&lt;/em&gt;, are you alright?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad nodded weakly as he felt a pair of strong hands lift him up and carried him off.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come on, &lt;em&gt;Himiinhaama&lt;/em&gt;, we&apos;re getting out of h-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He was cut off as he gave a cry of pain, causing him to drop Konrad. As he did so, Konrad heard that damn cackle again.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; he said weakly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched with one open eye as Spinal slashed at Eagle from all directions, torturing him, tormenting him as he circled, ran toward and teleported all around him, the arena filled with maniacal laughter. After dealing a certain amount of damage to the Native American, the skeleton leapt up, folded its arms together over its chest and sunk into the ground, teleporting right into Eagle, lifting him into the air and causing him to crash down hard.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pushing himself up, Konrad struggled to get himself onto one shaky arm as the little shit teleported several times, playing with the injured Eagle as he stumbled back and forth on his feet before knocking him onto his back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once Eagle fell, Spinal slashed the downed figure across his chest, then raised up its disgusting shield into the air. Konrad&apos;s brows furrowed as it started to glow.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;What is it doing?&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he wondered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the music stopped altogether, much to everyone&apos;s confusion. Then, lights in the stadium shut down, causing a few people to scream, leaving the shield as the sole source of light as the arena began to fill up with a thick mist. To Konrad&apos;s horror, the dead security guards that lay all around him rose to their feet, picking up their dismembered selves, several of them walking out from the fighter alleys with struggling personnel and the other surviving security guards in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter squinted as he tried peering through the thick smoky haze.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can any of you see anything in there?&quot; he said to the other bodyguards.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nope,&quot; Michael answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Me neither,&quot; said Lawrence.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The building shook violently.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the hell?&quot; Dieter said. &quot;An earthquake?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad remained still and tense as he peered through the mist. There were certain benefits a <text:soft-page-break/>lycanthrope enjoyed, one of them being enhanced senses, but at that moment, however, Konrad would have given anything not to have them.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once the shaking stopped, he saw something.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is that noise?!&quot; Roger demanded as there came a sound of crackling gravel and a pair of soft booms.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the hell is going on in there?!&quot; Michael asked nervously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;There came a swishing noise, followed by a loud groan, so loud that Dieter felt it rumble through his own body. There was also a very loud heaving noise that sucked air in and rumbled out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the fuck is that?!&quot; Dieter exclaimed. &quot;Do you guys hear that?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Probably a generator,&quot; Lawrence reasoned quietly. &quot;A faulty fan, maybe?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;There came a loud thud that caused the booth to shake, as if something large had landed onto the ground. Then, there was a strange fleshy noise, followed by an awful chorus of screams. People were crying for help, begging to be let go, crying for their parents, to whatever deity listened. Lots of people cried out to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The screaming became so unbearable that the men had to clasp their hands to their ears, staying like that until it stopped. It was only for a few minutes, but it felt like an eternity.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once it was over, the lights flickered back on, revealing the bloody arena below.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter and the others gaped at what they saw.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;My god...&quot; the bodyguard uttered softly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Curled up in a fetal position for several minutes, Konrad opened his eyes nervously, his form trembling furiously. The entire stadium was empty. The only ones left were Spinal and Eagle, who lay unmoving on the ground. The former raising his shield high into the air, Konrad watched as the thing on its arm narrowed its beady eyes and elicited a fearsome roar, glowing green and somehow sucking in the air all around it. Once it was finished, the skeleton lowered the shield, tossed its skull back in a maniacal laugh in victory, then glanced back down at Eagle, tilting its head and shifting its jaw in curiosity before lunging at his fallen form, prepared to gleefully mutilate his unconscious body when a shot rang out, jerking its head back. Konrad glanced around, then stopped as Dieter and the rest of the bodyguards, including Michael, who was still dressed in Konrad&apos;s cloak, came charging in from one of the fighter alleys. Roger and Lawrence repeatedly smashed their feet down on the creature&apos;s skull while it was down while Michael and Dieter came to the Baron&apos;s side.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron! Are you okay?&quot; the bodyguard asked in concern.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad opened his mouth to say something, but as he did so, tiredness swept over him like a woolen blanket, causing him to lose consciousness as Dieter shouted at him repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:line-break/></text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">6.

The ground shook violently as spider cracks started to form in front of him. After a few minutes, if not seconds, Konrad saw something. Debris was tossed aside as a huge watermark stained the mist in front of him, causing Konrad to crane his neck further and further up, staring open-mouthed until the thing&apos;s head nearly scraped the ceiling. From what he saw through the mist, a gigantic humanoid torso marked with glowing runes or glyphs protruded out from the ground, the top of its head reminding Konrad of crowns worn by pharaohs in Lower Egypt in ancient times. Its face consisted of a single long white door, and as it glanced around, breathed and groaned an odorous vapor that reeked of decay and dirt, the door split into four worm-like mandibles with panels at each end.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Konrad knew that what he saw wasn&apos;t any hallucination or spirit - it was a real living creature, for every time it moved he heard, felt and saw the air being displaced, causing some of the mist to swirl in its wake. Even more, it had a distinctive malodorous scent that polluted the air, reminding Konrad of beef that had been left out for weeks unrefrigerated during a hot summer. Every time it breathed, Konrad felt the hairs on his body being blown back or pulled forward in conjunction with every inhalation or exhalation of hot air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lowering itself down so that its massive head was flat to the floor, its arms bent in support of its massive body, Konrad watched as it opened its mouth and as the dead security guards led their struggling captives to their doom. Once the security guards entered the creature&apos;s gullet, other indescribable creatures appeared and started dragging away the audiences, forcing Konrad to crawl up into a fetal position, covering his eyes and ears, trying to block out the awful screams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen listened in silence, his expression stony.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I swear, Jurgen,&quot; Konrad said as he shook his head from side to side, &quot;I&apos;ve never felt so frightened in my entire life!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I imagine so,&quot; the servant replied. &quot;It explains why you had urinated yourself.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat looked at him curiously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Urinated myself?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja,&quot; Jurgen said. &quot;We had to clean you and get those pants off because of the smell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad looked down in shame and embarrassment, his face sagging, the corners of his mouth and eyes drooping.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron,&quot; Jurgen said as he placed a comforting on his shoulder. &quot;Please don&apos;t feel <text:soft-page-break/>bad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I bet Dieter and the others had a right laugh at my expense,&quot; he said in a voice barely above a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I assure you, Herr Baron, no one was laughing at you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then they&apos;re having one right now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re not,&quot; Jurgen assured. &quot;But Herr Baron, there&apos;s something about your account that I don&apos;t understand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat brushed his hand against his nose.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If what you say is true, why didn&apos;t the creature take you and Eagle?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad was silent for a moment, deep in thought.

The attic was a dimly lit white area with a single light bulb hanging overhead and brown wooden footboards. Ten feet high and forty feet wide, the room was filled with old trunks, toys, picture frames, tables, chairs and other furniture that were all covered with canvases. At the far end of the attic, Dieter and the others were struggling with their task, tying down the two anomalies tightly on the tables.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Scheibe, this thing is strong!&quot; Lawrence said through gritted teeth, straining as he tried wrenching the cutlass from Spinal&apos;s bony hand. &quot;It&apos;s no good, Dieter!

The story of Heracles and his ascension into godhood along with the tragic tale of Orpheus and Eurydice were also well known, while Christianity makes reference to Christ and Lazarus rising up from the grave.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Bible also makes reference to the phenomenon in Ezekiel Chapter 37, Verse 7;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;...there was a noise, a rattling sound, and the bones came together, bone to bone.

To know that you stood in the presence of &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; evil, that you had it in your hands without even realizing and that your hands are now stained with &lt;em&gt;blood, &lt;/em&gt;your whole being&lt;em&gt; tainted&lt;/em&gt;...it made me noxious.

I was at the arena, Jurgen - it enjoys killing. Revels in it.

Even when everyone stood on it at the same time, the relic still didn&apos;t give way beneath their combined weight.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Picking up the relic, Konrad checked it front and back for damage.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter took out a lighter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Let me figure this out,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Handing it to him, Konrad watched as the bodyguard lit the mask with his lighter. It wasn&apos;t even burning, let alone catching fire. Neither the front, nor the back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Everyone stared at the thing in wonder.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is this thing?&quot; Michael said aloud.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Putting away his lighter, Dieter strained himself as he tried to break it in his hands and with his arms.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The fuck is this thing made of, diamond?!&quot; he exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Shaking his head, he handed it back to Konrad.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s no good.

It reminded him of a rotted corpse with its bones partially picked clean.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking a nervous step forward, the duo made their way to the entrance of the farmhouse.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad knocked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come in,&quot; a voice from inside called.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Opening the door, the duo took one step forward before drawing away quickly, gagging at the foul stench inside.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking a couple of deep breaths, they prepared themselves, then stepped into the building, plugging their noses as they glanced around.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Leaves and dead animals littered the floors while flies buzzed all around them, their black bodies bloated little dots that hummed as they fed on the decaying maggot-covered remnants.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Certain sections of the building&apos;s walls were missing, exposing some beams here and there.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ahead of them were an unfinished set of stairs while to the left was what looked to be a filthy kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;To the right of the entrance was what looked to be a dimly lit den with a few chairs and a lit fireplace that crackled, the most complete-looking part of the house.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Sitting in one of the chairs in front of the fireplace, a man sat. Turning slightly in their direction, he gave an ugly grin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh, Baron Von Sabrewulf,&quot; he said in a deceptively smooth and velvety voice. &quot;I&apos;ve been expecting you. Come in, both of you, and sit by the fire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad and Dieter nervously glanced at each other, then took up his offer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Entering the room, Konrad noticed strange runic symbols on the walls and parts of the floor, painted in something red, the corners of the room lit with a collection of candles.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Next to the walls were various jars filled with a yellow fluid, each containing some specimen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad saw squirrels, hares, shrews, ravens, owls and various other birds and animals, while other jars had what appeared to be organs.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;One jar had something that suspiciously looked like a human hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;After carefully examining the chairs, they seated themselves down three feet away from him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad eyed the man next to him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Although Kan-Ra was a small man, only five foot five and barely over a hundred pounds - one hundred and three or one hundred and five, if Konrad were to give a proper estimate, - with a very frail-looking frame, that only belied the dangerous air about him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Bald, with white eyes devoid of irises or pupils, his skin had a sickly yellow cadaverous quality that looked gold in the light of the fireplace, covered in wrinkles and looked as if it was either decaying or like it was made from sand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Though he wore a long black coat that covered much of his body, his arms, legs and shoeless feet remained exposed, all covered in bandages, while relics of some sort gleamed from his waist, including what looked clearly like a horseshoe. Around his neck, Kan-Ra wore a gold necklace with seven or so thick round rubies along with a beaded turquoise necklace that had bits of gold, with six large emeralds that hung from the bottom of thick cylindrical bead pieces.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Holding his hands out to the fire, Konrad stared at the long claw-like nails on the tips of his fingers.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Everything about Kan-Ra repulsed him - his skin, his voice, his smell, which reeked of formaldehyde, sand and decay, but the ugliest feature he had, above all else, was his &lt;em&gt;smile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Though his dental hygiene was superb, with perfectly shaped and colored teeth that would make any dentist proud, it was the manner in which he smiled that made Konrad&apos;s flesh creep. It was by far the &lt;em&gt;ugliest&lt;/em&gt; smile he had ever seen on a person, a wide, cruel and horrible-looking thing that made it look as if the skin was pulled taut against the man&apos;s skull. Every time he smiled, it looked as if the whole man&apos;s face and head would split in half at any given moment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Had not it been for his condition, Konrad would have done everything in his power to avoid being in the presence of the grinning man.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;What I would give to smack that smile off his ugly face,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought in loathing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad had first met Kan-Ra at a low-end auction in a downtown section of Munich ages ago, <text:soft-page-break/>when the latter sneered at him for purchasing a fake relic.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s first thoughts were to beat the arrogant man&apos;s brains out, but he had refrained from doing so for fear of being spotted moving from his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Before he could demand an explanation, the enigmatic figure gave him the address to his home on a piece of paper, introducing himself as a collector and seller of rare antiquities that specialized in the types of things he sought before disappearing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Perplexed, Konrad initially dismissed him as an insane hoaxer at the time.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When the aristocrat had lost his voice and none of the doctors believed him able to recover, however, desperation forced him to visit the strange figure in this equally strange place. Once he finished drinking down the most revolting-tasting concoction ever created, Konrad had then experienced the most excruciating pain in his throat that he ever felt. His throat burned and ached as he sputtered, and Dieter had been just about ready to gun down the ghoulish figure when Konrad&apos;s voice returned. Since then, the two continued to do business with each other.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So, tell me, Baron,&quot; Kan-Ra said, his grin flashing in the light of the fireplace while the rest of his face was concealed in shadow, &quot;why have you come this time? Are you interested in performing another trade? I know I have some pickled rodent brains that could be of use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, Kan-Ra,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;I came only for information.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kan-Ra gave him a curious look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Information?&quot; he repeated. &quot;What subject?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you know of Spinal?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He lifted his head at that.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh, the Devil&apos;s spinal column!&quot; he said. &quot;William Accola&apos;s little pet project. I haven&apos;t heard that name in years.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know of it?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed,&quot; he said. &quot;The creature has had a very long and bloodied history. I had even provided Accola himself with some materials for his research.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad blinked in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; Accola?!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;That&apos;s impossible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kan-Ra gave him an amused look, but didn&apos;t respond.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How old are you?&quot; Konrad asked curiously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The pale eyed man grinned, then gave a dark chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What can you tell me about it?&quot; Konrad pressed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What will you give in exchange?&quot; he said, his Cheshire grin growing. &quot;I don&apos;t offer my services for free.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Reaching into the pocket of his cloak, Konrad pulled out a small bag and tossed it to him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Catching it with one hand, Kan-Ra lowered it down into view as he opened it up. One of the peculiarities about dealing with Kan-Ra, at least in Konrad&apos;s experience, was that the man treated legal tender with an open level of disdain.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;In fact, when offered vast sums of money for his expertise or relics, sums that would have made Jurgen scream in outrage, Kan-Ra would pointedly refuse all offers and turn him away.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;However, he did display a peculiar fondness for currency of a much older type, usually gold coins from antiquity, but often the only things that interested Kan-Ra were gems, even those that were considered unremarkable or inexpensive. Konrad suspected that the man was daft, but he never voiced his opinion out loud in his presence.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Rolling the gems into the palm of his hand, Kan-Ra examined them, picking them up piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You approve?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He received his answer in the form of a grin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How can I help you?&quot; Came the reply.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What can you tell me of Spinal and the mask of Ancients?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The pale-eyed man leaned back in his chair, looking almost like he was closing his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The creature has gone by many names throughout the centuries,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of them are probably already familiar to you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Loki?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The corner of his mouth lifted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s one,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The auction that I bought this from said that the mask possesses features that commemorated some of the Mesopotamian gods and goddesses. Innana, Suen, Enki the god of magic. Ereshkigal the goddess of the underworld, her fearsome husband Nergal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kan-Ra shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t say with much certainty, but it is my belief that those features were added on at a later period. Then again, I haven&apos;t examined the mask,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t tell you every aspect of the mask&apos;s history due to the fact that a lot of it remains unknown, but what I do know with certainty was that it had changed hands numerous times throughout the ages, wielded across the globe. Pirates, bandits, mercenaries, warlords, emperors,...kings.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He paused.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Among those had been Neriglissar of Babylon, who used Spinal to conquer the armies of King Appuasu as well as seize the royal cities of Ura and Kirsi, burning everything and everyone to the ground.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jesus,&quot; Dieter muttered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kan-Ra smirked. He had a distant look in his eye, as if somehow remembering or reliving the experience.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;With it he also destroyed the city of Pitusu, and from the pass of Sallune to the border of Lydia, fires were started.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You should learn to hide the elation in your voice,&quot; Konrad muttered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The man scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Elation? Hardly,&quot; he said. &quot;The Greeks, Persians, and Romans had used it extensively in their wars. I heard rumors that supposedly Alexander the Great had it at one point until it was stolen in the middle of the night. In 79 BC, some of the Romans became so fearful of the creature that they chucked him and the mask into a volcano in order to destroy them both.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Obviously a false report,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wouldn&apos;t say so,&quot; he said. &quot;The volcano that the creature had been tossed into was Mount Vesuvius.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s brows furrowed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mount Vesuv-?!&quot; he said. &quot;Are you saying that Spinal was responsible for the destruction of Pompeii?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kan-Ra didn&apos;t say anything. He only gave a disgusting smile before continuing with his accounts.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The relic eventually found its way among the Germanic peoples, one of the most notable users being, albeit very briefly, Attila the Hun, before the artifact was stolen again. The Vikings had also laid claim to the mask, using him for much of their conquests. At least, before the Crusaders got hold of the relic. They too used it in some of their battles, but a lot of effort was made to destroy it. It&apos;s made its way through China, India, Japan, the Americas...I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a single continent or piece of land that &lt;em&gt;hadn&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; been stepped on by Spinal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad looked at him eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do we destroy it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kan-Ra took a long time answering.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;As far as I know,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;I don&apos;t think a way exists. At least, not yet. Many have tried crushing it, burning it, stabbing it, trampling it underfoot or by carriage, throwing it to the bottom of the sea...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;For all intents and purposes, both the mask and the creature it controls are completely indestructible,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Konrad lowered his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Damn.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not what you were hoping to hear, I see,&quot; Kan-Ra said before giving another one of those hideous smiles. &quot;If you would like, I could take the mask for myself, that way you wouldn&apos;t have to be concerned about carrying the burden.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Alarms were blaring off loudly in the aristocrat&apos;s head the moment the man said that.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No thank you,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Kan-Ra asked in a tone that smacked of insincere concern to the aristocrat. &quot;You already have troubles of your own. Are you sure that you&apos;d be up to the task?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll manage,&quot; Konrad retorted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kan-Ra gave a shrug.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;As you wish,&quot; he replied. &quot;See yourselves out.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad nodded to Dieter, then got up. As they left the room, Konrad looked over his shoulder to see Kan-Ra leaning down to his left, picking up an old lyre from the floor beside his chair. Once he straightened himself back up, the pale-eyed man brushed his long nails against its strings, then started to play a song.* It was an oddly hollow and poignant tune that made the aristocrat pause in his steps.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning back to face the door, Konrad left the strange man as he stared ahead into the fireplace, lost in apparent recollection, the smile gone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what do you make of what he says?&quot; Dieter asked as he drove the car.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shook his head in the backseat.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;One never knows with that man,&quot; he replied. &quot;What about you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter raised his chin up thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If what he says is true,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;then we&apos;re not getting rid of this thing anytime soon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That had crossed my mind too, unfortunately.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So,&quot; Dieter said, &quot;why not make the best of it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad gave him a quizzical look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Make the best of it&apos;?&quot; he repeated. &quot;Dieter, this isn&apos;t some flat tire or a misplaced order.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I mean, Baron,&quot; Dieter said, &quot;is why not use today&apos;s technology to study it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Baron quietly digested the words, then gave a slow nod.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That actually is a good idea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course it is!

Sometimes I get stir-crazy, like I&apos;m being suffocated in this damn castle, in this damn wheel chair! So many eyes keeping people out, yet those same eyes keep me in, forcing me to do nothing but&lt;em&gt; think&lt;/em&gt;, wondering and worrying about whether someone just happened to catch a glimpse of me or not. Wondering about whether or not I&apos;m still a man or if I&apos;m less than a man now.

I can&apos;t put a shirt, shoe or suit on without ripping it to hell because my neck and feet have become too thick! The last woman I dated <text:soft-page-break/>and kissed was when I was a teenager! There&apos;s so many things I wanted to do, but I&apos;m almost fifty years old and it seems like a lifetime has passed by without me knowing it.

To become some sort of spokesperson for the Wolf men and women of the world?!&quot; Konrad muttered. &quot;Ja,&lt;em&gt; that&apos;s&lt;/em&gt; precisely what I want to be known for! Forgive me if I&apos;m not as altruistic and as self-sacrificial as you suggest, Jurgen, but I still have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; self-respect!

Is that your idea of self-respect and not wanting to be humiliated?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad violently yanked the broken piece of the armrest that dangled from his wheelchair and flung it hard at Jurgen, who barely had time to duck down as it slammed against the wall and clattered to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s hand trembled furiously as he stared angrily at Jurgen. Raising himself back up and turning around toward the ramp, the servant faced the door, his back facing his employer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You need to call Mr. Kellog,&quot; Jurgen said in an even voice, not bothering to look at him. &quot;We&apos;ll talk about this later.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Jurgen departed, Konrad remained in the garage, staring dejectedly to the floor, his form still.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Later, Konrad worked quietly on his laptop in the den at a desk, the fireplace burning behind <text:soft-page-break/>him. He didn&apos;t want to have the meeting in his office, not with ARIA listening in. Once he made certain that everything was in proper working order, he activated the vid-screen on his laptop, watching as David and the other Board members appeared onscreen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, there you are! Guttentag, everyone!&quot; he greeted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah! Mr. Chairman,&quot; David responded neutrally. &quot;Glad to hear from you. We have much to discuss.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dread settled itself onto Konrad&apos;s shoulders as he waited to be blasted for his incompetence and gross mishandling of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dread turned into surprise as David started to let out a hearty chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well done on last night&apos;s show, Mr. Chairman!&quot; he approved.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad blinked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What?&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David boisterously laughed along with others at his response.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you hear the earnestness and confusion in his voice?&quot; he said through his chuckles, his laughter infectious.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Soon everyone onscreen were laughing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I-I knew that you were resourceful and talented, Mr. Chairman,&quot; David said as he wiped his eyes, &quot;but last night&apos;s program really showed you pulling out all the stops. People absolutely loved it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;They did?&quot; Konrad asked, taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh yes,&quot; David said. &quot;The ratings for that episode were through the roof! As of this moment it&apos;s the number one video on YouTube.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad frowned. Fucking YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The special effects that you employed were remarkable. The creatures were so lifelike. Who did the special effects?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared awkwardly at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, well, it was, uh...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Go ahead, Mr. Chairman,&quot; David said patiently.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The creatures were...they were...&quot; he stammered, &quot;done by an independent special effects crew.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; David said interestedly. &quot;What are they called?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;They&apos;re new kids on the block,&quot; Konrad lied. &quot;Nobody would have heard of them. They did some low budget horror movie stuff.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hope they weren&apos;t expensive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;They weren&apos;t.&quot; Konrad assured.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, kudos to them,&quot; David said. &quot;They did an outstanding job. People especially loved the werewolf.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat blinked. &quot;Really?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Absolutely. There were, however, a few issues.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad narrowed his eyes. &quot;What issues?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of the viewers were complaining about the lack of realism in the werewolf&apos;s movements and the way it was fighting. A werewolf is supposed to bite and howl.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So I understand,&quot; Konrad muttered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Also,&quot; David continued, &quot;they didn&apos;t really know what to call it, so they had no way of identifying it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It has a name,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Really? What is it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat inhaled through his nostrils, then sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sabrewulf...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Sabrewulf&lt;/em&gt;!&quot; David burst out laughing, the whole room and screen joining in with him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad remained still, then faked a few chuckles.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;David wiped the tears away from his eyes as everyone settled down.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh my god,&quot; he said between breaths. &quot;Oh, that is funny!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m glad you are amused, David,&quot; Konrad lied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I should have known that you&apos;d do something like that!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;you know me. I&apos;m a regular jokester, as you say.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The audience will love it!&quot; he said, chuckling. &quot;Plus it fits!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad laughed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes! Yes, it does!&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As the laughter died down, David took a moment to recover.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh. Where was I?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You were talking about other issues,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah yes. Other issues,&quot; David repeated. &quot;I have to admit the graphic content was rather unnecessary with the skeleton transformation, plus we&apos;ve been getting letters from upset parents about that nudist that ruined the pre-game show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat gaped at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re serious?&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh yes,&quot; David said. &quot;That was absolutely dreadful. You really ought to increase security to keep that sort of thing from happening again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;I would, but given that the building is now destroyed, thanks to that &lt;em&gt;earthquake&lt;/em&gt;, that will have to take a backseat for now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed,&quot; David nodded. &quot;That was unfortunate business, although thankfully no one got hurt. All of the damages should be covered by our insurance company, though, including the Theseus androids you rigged. Terrible shame about Eagle&apos;s manager.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Speaking of which, have you heard from Eagle?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Konrad lied. &quot;He said that he&apos;s going on holiday someplace. Didn&apos;t tell me where, exactly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well it&apos;s silly really. People have been commenting on his absence from the news and social media lately and were growing concerned, even going so far as to believe that what happened last night was actually real!&quot; David said the last part with a laugh. &quot;But that&apos;s very reassuring. If you could get in touch with him and abate these fears, it would be much appreciated.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat looked darkly at the screen, his mouth drawn in a tight grim line.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll try,&quot; he said. &quot;So I take it you and the others would like to cancel the show?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the contrary, Mr. Chairman. After much discussion, the Board and I actually feel that more could be gained with this shift in the program&apos;s focus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You do?&quot; Konrad said in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Absolutely. Since monsters are popular with the mainstream, especially with teenagers and children, there&apos;s plenty of potential licensing and merchandising opportunities available, so we&apos;re all in favor of your renewal of the copyright. Of course, the decision to continue with this is yours, Mr. Chairman,&quot; David said. &quot;What say you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He stared at the screen in contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t imagine that the program would continue to have high ratings with just two monsters,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, maybe mix it up a bit,&quot; David said. &quot;Have someone fight the skeleton, someone else the werewolf, then each other. Once that&apos;s finished, bring in a new monster into the fold.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You want &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; monsters?&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But of course. Diversification is one of the keys to success, Mr. Chairman, and as you have pointed out there&apos;s only so much you can do with only two characters. Besides, it will keep the show fresh and the audiences on their toes in anticipation. They&apos;ll love it!&quot; David explained.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad winced. Him and his big fat mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Will it be a problem?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad thought about it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, it won&apos;t,&quot; he answered. &quot;However, if we&apos;re to renew the copyright, the tournament will need to undergo some revisions, especially in its format.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fair enough. What do you have in mind?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Larry!&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Gwen, I&apos;m going away.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Away? But why?&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve got to go. I can&apos;t stay here any longer.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;Let me go with you. I&apos;ll fetch a few things and be back in a minute.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;No, no. I&apos;m going alone.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;But I can help you!&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;You wouldn&apos;t want to run away with a murderer, would you?&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Larry, you&apos;re not.

It might even...&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;Please! I&apos;ve still got the charm you gave me, remember?&quot; Gwen said as she showed him the charm around her neck. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know, but I&apos;m afraid,&quot; he said as he took her hand, then paused, staring down into the palm as a pentagram appeared, marking her as his next victim.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Larry! What is it?&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Your hand.&quot; he said in horror. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I can&apos;t see anything.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Mr. Talbot.&quot; A man said, wearing his robe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Father! I&apos;m going with Larry.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;No, it&apos;s no use!&quot; Larry exclaimed as he ran out of the door.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amen to that,&quot; Konrad said as he raised his glass of wine to Lon Chaney, taking a long gulp before refilling it. Leaning back against the wall on his bed, his cloak discarded, he continued watching &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; until he heard a knock.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who is it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s Lawrence, Herr Baron.&quot; The voice said from the other side of the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come in,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Lawrence stepped into the room as the Baron paused the movie and put his glass onto a nearby drawer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Does Jurgen need something?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, Herr Baron, just me.&quot; Lawrence said nervously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Lawrence gave him an uncomfortable look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would like to resign,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad blinked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have I been a terrible employer?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, Herr Baron!&quot; Lawrence affirmed, shaking his head. &quot;Not at all. I like working for you, and I can&apos;t think of many that I&apos;d rather serve.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What brought on this change?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know this might come off as something of a shock, Herr Baron,&quot; Lawrence said slowly, &quot;but these past few hours have given me much to think about.

He should remind either Jurgen or Dieter to get some soundproofing equipment or walls constructed up in the attic. The little bastard was making a lot of noise and if left unattended it could spell problems.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad wondered if the servants had heard the commotion.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Speaking of which, where is everyone?&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he wondered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;The building seemed oddly empty.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Moving down a corridor lined with the ivory busts of his ancestors on either side, Konrad glanced upon each member of the Sabrewulf household. On his left was Wilhelm Von Sabrewulf, the first of the Konrad&apos;s lineage who received the title of Freiherr during the time of the Holy Roman Empire. Outside of his having been so along with the fact that he had participated in a war, quite possibly the Thirty Years&apos; War, little else was known about him. In fact, much of the same could be said of the other men whose likenesses were depicted in ivory form. Jurgen and his father Max tried to make it a point for Konrad to recognize the achievements and greatness of these men, along with some of their faults, but the only thing Konrad felt toward them was bitterness.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Shifting his attention away from the busts, he ignored their staring eyes as he passed them by.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once Konrad had gotten downstairs, he looked around suspiciously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nobody seemed to be around.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;What the hell was going on?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot; he called.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He waited for a response.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hello?&quot; he repeated.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen appeared from around the corner with a tray in hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, just in time, Herr Baron,&quot; he said. &quot;I have your dinner prepared and was just about to put it onto the dining room table. Just give me a moment, sir. I&apos;ll be right with you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad waited as the man disappeared briefly, then reappeared to guide him in.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where is everyone?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I gave the servants a day off,&quot; Jurgen said as he wheeled the aristocrat through a set of doors leading to the dining room. &quot;I also cancelled your appointments with Dr. Gupte and Mr. Zhou so that you would get the chance to heal from your injuries.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad winced as he recalled their last interaction. He felt ashamed of his behavior. He very nearly hurt the servant, the one person he counted and depended upon for years. While it was true that Dieter was a loyal friend, Jurgen was more than that; he was family. A brother. One who had seen Konrad at his worst, something that would have driven many away. And yet, despite everything, he continued to serve by his side with unparalleled patience and dedication.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you, Jurgen,&quot; he said as he wheeled to the table.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The servant bowed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry,&quot; Konrad said quietly. &quot;For my outburst, and for flinging part of the armrest at you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The servant patted him on the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;All forgiven, mein freund,&quot; Jurgen said. &quot;Keine Ursache.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He then stared at the wheelchair, studying the broken section where the armrest used to be.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll have to call someone to get a replacement for you later,&quot; he said.

Through the glass, Konrad saw a puddle on the floor of the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking notice of the three men as they entered the room, the staff turned in their direction. One man, a bald, cheerful, chubby cherubic-looking fellow with glasses and rosy cheeks approached.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron Von Sabrewulf!&quot; he said excitedly. &quot;It&apos;s so good to see you, sir!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good to see you as well, Dr. Rogers,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s been ages since you&apos;ve been down here,&quot; Rogers said, then took notice of Ferris. &quot;Who&apos;s this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Rogers, meet Ben Ferris,&quot; Konrad introduced. &quot;Mr. Ferris is a guest.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The scientist glanced suspiciously at the man.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why is he in handcuffs?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s for protection, his and ours,&quot; Konrad explained. &quot;Mr. Ferris is a person with a particularly violent disposition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shouldn&apos;t you call the police?&quot; Rogers asked nervously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Too right, Herr Doctor,&quot; the aristocrat replied as he eyed the freezer, &quot;but I have a use for Mr. Ferris.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He folded his arms behind his back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what&apos;s so special about this place?&quot; Ferris asked. &quot;What&apos;s with the box?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad grinned beneath his hood and scarf.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You should feel honored to be here, Mr. Ferris,&quot; he said. &quot;This is what started Ultratech down the road to success! Nobody else at the company knows about this except everyone around you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris gave him a confused look. &quot;I don&apos;t get it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Several years ago,&quot; Konrad began, &quot;I made a series of mistakes. &lt;em&gt;Costly&lt;/em&gt; mistakes. I purchased a great number of artifacts and...services, all of which turned out to be useless. I tried my luck at casinos, where I drank to hide from my problems and gambled away in desperation to make a fortune back. I nearly ruined the company in my search of a cure, Mr. Ferris. I searched every corner of the world, and all I found were liars, lunatics and fucking idiots.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He began to walk toward the walk-in freezer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;One such consultation took place in Nepal,&quot; he said, &quot;where some little shitstain of a man tried to con me. Dejected, I strolled alone and just wandered aimlessly along the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He stopped just in front of the glass.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;One day, I found something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And this is the big secret?&quot; he said. &quot;A puddle?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is no mere puddle, Mr. Ferris,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As the mercenary opened his mouth to respond, the puddle rippled, drawing everyone&apos;s attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Ferris said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as the stream slowly enlarged itself, then ducked down suddenly back as a puddle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whoa! Did you see that?!&quot; Ferris said to Dieter. &quot;What is that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shhh!&quot; Konrad hissed in annoyance, then glanced back to the puddle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh come now, come now, mein freund,&quot; Konrad said gently, as he tapped the glass and used sign language as he spoke. &quot;No need to be shy. Come out. There&apos;s someone here to meet you. Show him what you can do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat watched as the puddle expanded itself and molded itself into a variety of shapes. It started off with simple, singular one dimensional shapes on the ground such as a square, a rectangle, a circle and a triangle.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very nice,&quot; Konrad applauded and signed with his hands. &quot;What else can you do?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The puddle then divided itself, forming two triangles that circled around each other.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris walked up to the box with his mouth open, his eyes fixed on the show before him while Dieter kept a firm hold on his arm.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wha...&quot; he muttered. &quot;Is this some sort of hologram?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein, nein, it&apos;s all real,&quot; Konrad said. He turned his attention back to the entity and moved his hands as he spoke. &quot;Now, mein freund, why don&apos;t you really let yourself loose!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The puddle continued dividing itself until whole clusters of shapes swirled and danced along the floor, their forms blending into one another, even through each other. Once it was finished doing simple two dimensional shapes, it moved onto more three dimensional ones such as pyramids, cubes, cones, and spheres. Clusters of pyramids circled around cylinders while prisms formed from spheres. To Konrad, it was almost like watching a symphony in motion. From these three dimensional shapes, more complex shapes and patterns started to emerge, from spiralling helixes to tetrahedrons to icosidodecahedrons to rhombic triacontahedrons to toroidal polyhedrons to small stellated dodecahedrons to great cubicuboctahedrons and other shapes that Konrad&apos;s never seen before. The floor of the freezer now looked like a strange landscape or a bizarre multidimensional city complete with towers, growing more and more until from some of the polyhedrons organic and animalistic shapes started to emerge, a lot of which Konrad was certain never existed on Earth. Various pieces, figures and shapes started to move, dance, swim and float around in the air, swirling naturally. It was almost like seeing something underwater. From these figures, shapes and other pieces, it then formed other structures, what looked like a depiction of atoms, molecules and the like before going into more epic, elaborate and ambitious set pieces, including an incredible depiction of what could only be the Big Bang. From there, constellations and solar systems emerged, followed by asteroids, black holes and more. The performance was dizzying in its scope and scale, moving so fast that Konrad couldn&apos;t take any more.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s enough,&quot; he said and signed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The images faltered, reverting back into tiny droplets that rained down onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That was lovely!&quot; Konrad said and signed to the puddle as it reformed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is this?&quot; Ferris asked. &quot;Is this...what is it...nanotechnology?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein, nein. Nanotechnology is nowhere near this complex,&quot; Konrad said. He then gestured to the entity in the room. &quot;Show him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The puddle slowly rose and molded itself into a tall humanoid shape that solidified before everyone. Standing at six-four with a heavily muscled body, the entity&apos;s torso and head were composed entirely of fresh snow that sparkled and glinted in the light of the freezer, the arms and legs composed of a mixture of rock and ice. White in color, the hands were huge and had a strange rubbery quality about them, with three digits and an opposable thumb on both, while the feet, though very humanoid in shape and structure, had only three toes on each foot. Devoid of either a mouth or nose, a pair of striking emerald eyes stared out from a featureless, jagged, cliff-face-like mound, while a collection of stalactite-like icicles formed a sort of beard at the bottom of its chin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris stared agape at the creature as it stared back, the entity whistling a high pitched noise before making a strange full-chested purring sound.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;What. The. Fuck. Is. That?&quot; he said slowly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Homo Glacius,&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad winced as he heard the word uttered from the bodyguard&apos;s mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Homo Glacies&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; he corrected. &quot;Latin for &quot;ice man&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what is it?&quot; Ferris asked. &quot;Is it one of your experiments or something?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t be ridiculous,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then how did you get it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I told you, Mr. Ferris,&quot; he said patiently, &quot;I found him in Nepal, near a Hindu shrine in the snow-covered mountains after he crash-landed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Crash-landed?!&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Ferris repeated. &quot;Wait a minute, are you saying that-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, Mr. Ferris,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The mercenary stared at both the creature and Konrad in shock and disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where&apos;s his ship?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s in a warehouse,&quot; Dr. Rogers said, &quot;but it&apos;s not really a &quot;ship&quot; per se. If anything it&apos;s more of an elaborate...techno-organic shell to maneuver itself in space.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why did it crash?&quot; Ferris asked. &quot;Was it shot down?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad amusedly watched as the tough mercenary seemed to revert into an enthusiastic teenager.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Like watching someone that just found out that Santa Claus is real,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; he answered. &quot;There were no signs of such. A working hypothesis that everyone seems to favor at the moment is that the creature came too close to our planet before eventually being pulled down by its gravity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But...how is it that no one knows about this?&quot; Ferris asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;People had,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;but with a little compensation, a few favors and some strings pulled here and there, it&apos;s amazing how easy it is to get people to keep quiet and cooperative with the right tools, resources and motivation. Since then Nepal has considered me its friend and benefactor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How is it able to do all of that?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shrugged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re still struggling to understand it ourselves,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Some of us believe that the ice is in actuality some sort of &quot;suit&quot;, but others believe that the creature is some sort of hive or conglomerate of microorganisms that sustain themselves with cold temperatures and water. Some believe that it&apos;s merely composed of a brain that telekinetically controls the elements around it. The truth is, no one knows.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But can&apos;t you tell from its DNA?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ve been trying for years, but the creature&apos;s genome is unlike anything on this planet, with structures and elements never seen before. We&apos;ve barely decoded even a fraction of its DNA. For all intents and purposes, &lt;em&gt;Homo Glacies&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most evolved creatures on the planet, if not &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; most evolved. Possibly even in the universe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are there others like it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat was quiet for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Possibly,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You haven&apos;t heard from them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m afraid not,&quot; he said. &quot;Even if they tried to, communication would have been impossible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But I saw you talk with that thing using sign language,&quot; Ferris said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, but it doesn&apos;t have the physiological apparatus necessary for human communication,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The creature blinked as it watched them, whistling and humming.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Those sounds you hear? Those are the extent to any sort of vocal communication. We tried using audio equipment to decode them and communicate with it, but our equipment isn&apos;t even powerful enough. Several of my best have tried deciphering it, but it&apos;s impossible. So, we had to teach it sign language, something that took us years to do, but even then, we still have problems communicating with it. Apparently the semantics of his language can have a multitude of meanings that not even human beings could understand.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as Homo Glacies tilted its head, blinking curiously at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It sounds like your discovery of the big fella was a bust,&quot; Ferris said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;On the contrary, Mr. Ferris,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;While we haven&apos;t been able to learn much from Homo Glacies, we have had learned a great deal from its shell.

When the mercenary slowly started to rise up from the gurney and stood up onto his feet, Konrad&apos;s hairs stood on end. Ferris&apos; entire body was now completely covered in flame with a red aureola surrounding him, his head and face an orange featureless mass with a pair of red orbs that glowed like hot coals. The floor hissed as his featureless feet burned into the tiles, his breathing a harsh heaving that sounded like a furnace while embers shimmered and flaked off from his perpetually burning body, crackling and popping noisily. As he straightened himself up, he studied his hands, arms and the rest of his body.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Is there a mirror around here?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Ferris asked, his voice a simmering volcanic hiss.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Rogers swallowed, shaking his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m-I&apos;m afraid not,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris took a step towards them, causing everyone to back away and put considerable distance between themselves and the fiery effigy as it made its way over to the walk-in freezer and stopped directly in front of the glass, pausing as it stared into the glass.

For one, the sound of his own breathing seemed to be amplified in his ears; despite the fact that he was breathing normally, to him it sounded deafening. Breathing in the suit felt like he was breathing through a very small and tight vent. Even more, the way the suit clung tightly around him made it feel as if it was some bizarre Medieval torture device that was designed to suffocate him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&apos;Think pleasant thoughts,&apos; he thought to himself.

Konrad violently struggled to wrench the hands loose, then raised his own hands up to his chest, slammed <text:soft-page-break/>them down into the crook of its arms and head-butted, causing it to stagger off him. Grabbing the bottle, he continued to bash it into the creature&apos;s skull over and over until it stopped. Once it ceased moving, Konrad hastily grabbed its body and carried it piece by piece, then tied it quickly back to the table, making sure that every knot was tight and that it was secure. Satisfied, he glanced back to the bottle, then headed back downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No more drinks for you!&quot; Konrad said to the shield as he made his way back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He cringed as Spinal chuckled behind him. Hurrying out the attic, Konrad&apos;s heart raced as the laugh built its way up into an awful crescendo that echoed into the night, following him all the way from the long stretch of hallway to his bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stirred in his queens-sized bed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Shifting into various positions, he tried to make himself more comfortable, but no matter what angle, whether it was on his stomach, back or sides, he couldn&apos;t get himself to fall asleep. Moving to the other side, he snuggled under the covers, satisfied and relieved, his face pressed against the pillow, resting on top of his arms. It was an hour or so when he was in the midst of dozing off that Konrad became suddenly aware of a presence in the room. Turning to look over his shoulder, a startled jolt sent him sprawling awake as he caught sight of Spinal by the foot of his bed. Even though the vast majority of him was concealed in heavy shadow, there was no mistaking the glowing red eyes, the bleached whiteness of bone, the red bandana or that awful shield with the yellow runes and eyes. It just stood there in front of him unmoving, watching him, staring directly at him. A shiver worked its way through Konrad&apos;s entire body. When he opened his mouth, the only thing he could utter was a frightened moan, his attempt to scream dying at the back of his throat as his eyes bulged and hair pulled taut against his face. The two stared at each other, their gazes unwavering. Moving his furiously shaking hand to a lamp beside him, Konrad kept his eyes glued on the skeleton. Feeling his way along the table, fumbling as he knocked books onto the floor, he stopped the moment he felt the lamp. Pressing the switch, Konrad turned on the light, illuminating his room.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The moment the light came on, Spinal vanished.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Blinking, the aristocrat scanned his bedroom nervously, then got up and checked every corner, behind every piece of furniture in the room and underneath his own bed, even studied the space in front of the footboard where Spinal had stood, looking for some sign indicating his presence, that the little shit had been here.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad let out a shaky sigh, all the muscles in his body loosening as he settled back into his bed. Resting his back against the headboard, he stared in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Was he going crazy?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Had Spinal actually been in the room with him?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The skeleton could teleport at will, but when Konrad turned on the lights, there was no green flash or light like the other times.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Was it all a dream?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad had made certain that it had been secured to the table - there was no chance of it ever getting out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Was there?&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Part of him questioned.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So much for a pleasant night&apos;s sleep,&quot; he muttered to himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking to the toppled books on the floor next to him, he reached down and picked up one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Which one is this?&quot; he wondered. &quot;&apos;Faust&apos; by Goethe.

He&apos;s just another opportunity for you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad exhaled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;d be lying if I said that I didn&apos;t find the prospect of a new body attractive or that I had never considered it for myself when it occurred to me,&quot; he admitted. &quot;That said, there&apos;s too many variables and uncertainties with such a process. There&apos;s no guarantee that I&apos;d even be able to survive it. There&apos;s no guarantee that when I wake up after the surgery that I&apos;d still be the same person, that my mind would carry over into my new body. For all I know, opening myself up to...&quot;cyberization&quot;, could make my mind open for whoever to rewire, for hacking. I can imagine that David would be thrilled with such an opportunity. Just hack into my head and make me do or say something that will make me look stupid or compromise my position as Chairman. Hell, he wouldn&apos;t have to do anything at all. Things could happen on the surgery table. A stupid surgeon who doesn&apos;t know what they&apos;re doing is one of many hazards along with a good doctor that knows what they&apos;re doing but who has been paid to &quot;accidentally&quot; botch up the procedure. Mistakes, deliberate or otherwise, can happen on the surgeon&apos;s table. I considered all that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not a saint, Jurgen, nor did I claim to be morally superior.

I&apos;m trying to do what is right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The right thing to do, Herr Baron,&quot; Jurgen said, &quot;is to tell his brother and let him take care of Eagle, let him know what has happened.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jurgen, we&apos;ve already been through this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron, the longer you keep it from him, the worse it will get.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Worse?&quot; He repeated. &quot;How could it possibly get any worse? How is he worse than everything else around here? Let&apos;s do a tally, shall we? I&apos;m a four hundred pound werewolf with argyria. My arena was hijacked by a demonic skeleton that left a trail of bodies in its wake and promptly destroyed the building. The artifact connected to it is indestructible, leaving me stuck with the bloody thing.

What happened?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a bit embarrassing to say, really, but, um...&quot; she paused, inhaled deeply then sighed. &quot;They were eaten.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Eaten?!&quot; &lt;/em&gt;Konrad said in surprise. &quot;What do you mean &quot;eaten&quot;? What, some moron mistook my samples for ketchup or something?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein, nein,&quot; Gupte waved, &quot;it&apos;s nothing at all like that. One of the animal handlers carelessly forgot to properly lock one of the cages, which in turn allowed a king cobra to escape free.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A &lt;em&gt;king&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;cobra&lt;/em&gt;!&quot; Jurgen exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, but it&apos;s contained now,&quot; she assured.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good heavens, what is that doing here?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not as strange as you make it out to be,&quot; Gupte said. &quot;Snake venom contains biologically active ingredients that are useful for treating diseases. Viper venom, for example, is used for anticoagulant drugs, while crotoxin, proteins derived from the South American rattlesnake, are used in treatments for some forms of cancer. Cobra venom, though, is invaluable due to their containing a protein unique to them called ohanin, which is a highly potent painkiller twenty times more powerful than morphine.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And this snake ate the samples?&quot; Jurgen said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m afraid so,&quot; she replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad gave her a doubtful expression.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Forgive me, Herr Doctor,&quot; he said, &quot;but I smell bullshit.

Outside, a crowd of researchers were all clustered together in front of a door, murmuring to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s going on?&quot; Gupte demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of the cobra cages broke!&quot; someone said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shit,&quot; she swore. &quot;Was anyone hurt?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, ma&apos;am, but one of the snakes is acting all funny.

I want to see what is going on!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;People backed off as he pushed through toward the door. Opening it slowly, Konrad peered through the small crack.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Lying on the floor with the shattered glass was an enormous mass that was as long and as thick as a telephone pole, its form swollen and a pasty white. Nearby, animals were going berserk in their cages, with dogs barking loudly and furiously at the thick mound that lied on the floor. Two animal handlers approached the still creature, one of them carrying a large bag while the other held some sort of hook or instrument that&apos;s used for handling snakes. One of them stepped on a piece of glass, causing it to it suddenly launch itself straight up into the air, startling everyone, before collapsing back onto the ground again.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is going on with its skin?&quot; Jurgen asked. &quot;Is it dying?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look!&quot; A researcher pointed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The serpent swayed its tail from side to side weakly, then lifted it up and slammed it back to the floor. Konrad watched as its skin rippled, all of it accompanied by grotesque sounds of pops and crunches.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is happening to it?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nobody answered. Everyone was too caught up and fascinated by the thing as a shriveled up arm suddenly ripped free beneath the serpent&apos;s hood, spilling blood, fluid and dead skin aside. The color started to change, becoming more of a fleshy pink hue, giving the creature a vaguely fetal appearance as it pushed itself clumsily along the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s mutating!&quot; Gupte said in wonder.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad took out his cellphone. Dialing the number, he raised it to his ear.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter, I have a situation,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s going on?&quot; the bodyguard asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m in the basement next to the dungeon. Get your ass down here immediately!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hanging up, he put the cellphone away, watching as the creature crawled along the ground like some sort of alligator, dragging and brushing itself against cabinets and tables, knocking over beakers, microscopes and other equipment. Looking at its strange, googly-eyed head, it gave no indication of having intelligence. If anything, the creature didn&apos;t seem to be even &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;registering&lt;/em&gt; that it was moving at all as it flailed its arms about in all directions. Rolling over onto its back, it pitifully waved its hands in the air before rolling back indelicately onto its belly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;BARON! BARON?

One, two, three, LIFT!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Grunting with exertion, the four men struggled as the creature wriggled in their grip.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re going to need some more help please!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;OW!&quot; Roger yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;ROGER, ARE YOU OKAY?!&quot; Konrad yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, the damn thing scratched me,&quot; the bodyguard replied as other researchers came in to assist.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It took a total of twelve men and women to move the animal over to the cell. Konrad gagged and covered up his nose as the creature passed by him. It was an awful smell, a strong musky odor like a rotting animal carcass combined with something undefinable. Jurgen stared at the thing, unbothered by the smell. Michael had put as much distance as possible between himself and the creature, refusing to even look at it. Konrad watched as they placed it down inside and as the handler removed the blindfold.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can someone get me my hook, please?&quot; the handler asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter went back to the lab and brought it to him. Taking hold of it, the handler quickly got up. The creature just lay there. Backing away, Konrad watched as the handler used his hook to peel off the muzzle. Once it was off, he withdrew it, then closed the door and locked it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The tenseness that Konrad felt was gone.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank god that&apos;s over and done with,&quot; Jurgen said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what are you going to do with it, Herr Doctor?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ll need to run some tests on it,&quot; Gupte said. &quot;It&apos;ll take a while to thoroughly examine it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What about my blood tests?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;ll reschedule for another time, Herr Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Dieter and Roger approached him, Konrad plugged his nose while Michael vomited.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Aw Michael, for fuck&apos;s sake!&quot; the former swore.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry!&quot; Michael said weakly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad took notice of Roger&apos;s bleeding hand.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you okay?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard waved it off.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, it&apos;s just a scratch,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wash it off and get it bandaged,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not a big deal,&quot; Roger insisted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just humor me,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Shrugging, Roger approached the doctor, who then took him to the examination room.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You owe me, Baron,&quot; Dieter said angrily. &quot;Big time!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Believe me, Dieter, I know,&quot; Konrad replied. &quot;Get a shower, you smell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard nodded, then left without saying another word.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad felt eyes baring down on him, then turned to look up at Jurgen behind him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well don&apos;t look at me!

It wasn&apos;t the skeleton, <text:soft-page-break/>thank god. Wheeling himself into his private den, the aristocrat found Dieter, Michael and Roger seated on one of the couches, watching something on one of their cellphones, killing themselves with laughter. Closing the door behind him, Konrad watched the bodyguards curiously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you watching?&quot; he asked, drawing their attention.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;People made some gifs from your tournament,&quot; Dieter chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning his cellphone in his direction, Konrad scowled as the naked man from the tournament did a little dance while flapping his arms wildly, all of it done to the beat of dubstep.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Should have guessed,&quot; he replied. &quot;Can you turn that shit off please?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You hate dubstep, Baron?&quot; Dieter asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Loathe it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh come on!

I want to converse in private with the Board members on my laptop.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguards nodded and got up.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Michael paused though.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;we haven&apos;t offended you, have we?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;I just want to be alone when I have my meeting. Go.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He watched as Michael disappeared, following Roger and Dieter out the door, then set up his laptop after it had closed behind them.

Everything is in order.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good,&quot; Konrad said as he inserted a memory key into his laptop. &quot;After careful consideration of the various proposals submitted to me, I&apos;m afraid that none were sufficient enough to replace the Kilgore heavy assault android.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;This caused a series of murmurs amongst the Board members.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;However,&quot; he continued, &quot;despite this setback, I wish to put forward an alternative project. One that will revolutionize military technology.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad then brought up his email and typed in the addresses of everyone present, then attached the file from his USB.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Here is the file,&quot; he said before pressing &quot;Send&quot;, then waited.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat watched the screen as David and the others typed on their computers, then clicked on the attached file.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Project...Fulgore&apos;?&quot; the former read, puzzled by the title.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It sounds pretty violent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Violent?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;David, I&apos;m surprised by you. Have you completely forgotten your Latin?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David frowned.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I never possessed the aptitude for language in the same way you had, Konrad. Latin especially,&quot; he conceded. &quot;Could you enlighten us on its significance and meaning?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&apos;Fulgore&apos; is the ablative form for &apos;fulgor&apos;, meaning &apos;lightning&apos;, &apos;brightness&apos;, &apos;flash&apos;, &apos;glitter&apos;, &apos;gleam&apos; or &apos;splendor&apos;. It is also part of the name of a Roman goddess, Fulgora, who served as Jupiter&apos;s personal shield maiden and armorer, supplying him with his thunderbolts.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David nodded half interestedly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, that is all very interesting,&quot; he replied. &quot;And what pray tell is Project Fulgore?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;To put it simply, David,&quot; Konrad explained, &quot;it&apos;s a stepping stone. Imagine for a moment, ladies and gentlemen, that you all have a debilitating illness or condition. You can barely move, or you&apos;re in a coma, and your chances of recovery are very slim. What if, ladies and gentlemen, there was a way to escape such a horrible fate?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How?&quot; a woman asked, intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;By building a mechanical body.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David scowled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is this some sort of joke?&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not at all, David,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Chairman, this suggestion is ridiculous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it?&quot; Konrad queried. &quot;Look around you, David. We&apos;re all familiar with the restorative technologies such as artificial limbs, pacemakers, artificial hearts, 3D printed bones, organs and bionic implants. Also, how can we forget about our exoskeletons, BCIs, BBIs, or the cyborg tissues <text:soft-page-break/>developed at Harvard? Have you also forgotten about some of the remote control animals by our friends at DARPA?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, I&apos;m aware of all that,&quot; David said, &quot;but what you&apos;re suggesting goes beyond mere limb replacement or controlling some rodent or insect - you&apos;re suggesting a brain transplant, for heaven&apos;s sake! A person cannot survive such a process, nor do we have the means available for such a thing!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Precisely, which is why I said that Project Fulgore is merely a stepping stone to that eventuality,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;David, I am not looking to create a man with a machine for a body, I am talking about a machine with a human brain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bald man shook his head. &quot;I&apos;m afraid that I don&apos;t quite follow.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our current android models, while effective, are hackable,&quot; Konrad explained. &quot;A machine that utilizes the human brain for storing information, however, can counter that particular problem since the brain itself is one of nature&apos;s most advanced supercomputers, impossible to hack from an outside source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And hypothetically impossible to control, wouldn&apos;t it?&quot; David countered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not if we have the right equipment, which we most certainly do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And suppose that we do follow through on this mad scheme of yours, Mr. Chairman,&quot; David said slowly, &quot;there&apos;s still the issue of Ethics Committees and willing participants. I doubt that anyone would be eager to sign up for something that could potentially kill them, nor do I think that the former would sign this off. This entire thing reeks of potential lawsuits.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Really, David, you make it sound like I am Dr. Frankenstein or something!&quot; Konrad exclaimed. &quot;If you look at the proposal itself carefully, you will note that it wouldn&apos;t involve &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt; participants. Rather, the program will be reaching out through the proper channels involved with organ donation in the European Union such as Spain, Austria and Belgium along with the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t feel comfortable with this,&quot; David said as he shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why? When a person dies, they don&apos;t possess the same rights as they do in life, David - they are relegated to being property. Organ donation is perfectly legal, provided that the source is reputable, that the organ in question hasn&apos;t been attained through dubious means and that consent has been given before its removal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And how do you know this will work?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s all there, David,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;I&apos;ve also included financial figures, estimates, scholarly articles etc.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The estimates make me a bit concerned, Mr. Chairman,&quot; Sackett said. &quot;What you&apos;re proposing is&lt;em&gt; extremely&lt;/em&gt; expensive, even more than the Kilgore project.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, I&apos;m quite aware of that, but as I have noted the projections for profit are high.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I still think it is too risky,&quot; David said uncertainly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad was starting to feel nervous.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s more,&quot; he said suddenly. &quot;My men and I have stumbled upon something. A potential new energy source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;People murmured on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; David said curiously. &quot;Do tell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat hesitated for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;...It-it was discovered a few days ago by accident,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Research is being done and results look promising. Very promising.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; the bald man said with a smile, &quot;that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; interesting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t see any information about it here,&quot; one of the Board members noted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A report will be submitted in due time for your inspection,&quot; Konrad promised. &quot;If the energy is viable, we can use it to power Project Fulgore. Like I said, David, Project Fulgore is a stepping stone in more than enough ways for the company.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it clean? This energy you speak of?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We&apos;re still running tests.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;If it is, this could be just the thing we need,&quot; David said. &quot;After all, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; pressure from environmental groups and the public for our products to be more eco-friendly. The Board members and I will take a look at your proposal, but we will need some time to consider it.

I let it slip about there being a possible new energy source.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What energy source?&quot; Jurgen said in puzzlement. &quot;You made no indication of there being such.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter made an interesting point about how our Ghost skeleton in the attic seems to utilize some sort of energy and had suggested it be studied and possibly harnessed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it really a good idea, Herr Baron?&quot; the servant said worriedly. &quot;We don&apos;t know a thing about what we&apos;re dealing with here. For heaven&apos;s sake, what if that energy ends up creating more like it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought about that,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;which is why we need to study it, otherwise we ourselves could be at risk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And suppose that this energy isn&apos;t viable at all, Herr Baron,&quot; Jurgen said. &quot;What then?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then hopefully Project Cinder will prove to be a better option.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The servant stared at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know you disapprove, Jurgen, but I need &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;! I promised to have a report on it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then undo that promise.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jurgen-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, don&apos;t &quot;Jurgen&quot; me, Herr Baron!&quot; The servant snapped. &quot;This whole thing is absolutely repulsive. You have ruined a man beyond repair and recognition, you hope to experiment on another, and now you hope to parasitize off that creature?! Off of Ferris?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well what else do you expect me to do, Jurgen?!&quot; Konrad barked back. &quot;I am stuck with them! Spinal is indestructible, impervious to anything and everything. That piece of shit Ferris has now become a walking sun and possibly harbors radioactive materials in his body, and Eagle is a vegetable. Jurgen, I&apos;m trying my damnedest to do what is right, but they are going to cost money. Even if I just let them sit there and do nothing with them, it&apos;s going to cost me money just to contain them. Spinal has very nearly ruined me, and I cannot imagine the lives Ferris must have ruined himself. I&apos;m not like them, Jurgen. I want to save that boy&apos;s life. If I have to sacrifice two evil bastards for an innocent, then so be it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen&apos;s shoulders sagged.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron,&quot; he said, &quot;I&apos;m afraid for you.

Moving slowly toward them, Konrad watched as both doctors put on some latex gloves and took out some plastic containers, then started swabbing the skeleton. When they finished, they turned their attention to the shield. Gupte was in the midst of swabbing the driftwood when a tentacle brushed against her arm. Gupte always struck Konrad as a strong and capable woman, so to see her visibly flinch and jerk back violently from it as if she had been burned startled him. She stood back, staring at the shield with loathing before resuming her duty. When she briefly touched the shield&apos;s head, that brought a loud yell from Spinal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;WHAT IS HAPPENING?!&quot; Rogers yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Grunting loudly as he strained his muscles, it took all of Konrad&apos;s will and concentration to keep the creature from moving.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Keep working!&quot; He said through gritted teeth.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When they finished, the two doctors put their samples into their pockets.

Once he finished tightening, he backed away. Lowering his arm, Konrad watched as Spinal angrily started to thrash wildly on the table, yelling and roaring in rage as it tried to get free. Rogers and Gupte stared, flinching as it continued to wriggle around.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning around, Konrad handed them the mask.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do whatever it takes to get answers,&quot; he said. &quot;I want it all done as soon as possible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Several weeks later, Jurgen and Konrad visited Gupte and Rogers at her office.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I take it you have the report for Spinal?&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;She nodded, handing him a folder.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Medical reports for it were an enormous headache,&quot; Gupte replied as he opened and studied the information within. &quot;I had to call for a lot of favors on this one.

Several were just plain awful. A couple that Konrad really wanted to work with weren&apos;t available due to conflicting schedules, while a few were arrogant and stuck up. Others had questionable attitudes, opinions and Facebook profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The search became such that at one point Konrad had forced Dieter to drive around and get some Halloween effects make-up and masks along with how-to books, using his poor bodyguards and Jurgen for experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The results were, to put it bluntly, disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Paint jobs tended to be runny and got into everything including clothes and fur, while prosthetic pieces would clumsily hang off. Konrad&apos;s fur and fingers often got stuck together, making it a pain in the ass to work with. Sometimes they would get stuck to someone&apos;s face and the only way to pry them free was by giving Konrad&apos;s hand a bit of a trim with scissors, making otherwise adequate makeup jobs to sport the odd mustache or beard. It gave Dieter plenty of photo opportunities and laughs. Jurgen had to stop being a participant due to the fact that he was developing red and itchy skin, a previously undiscovered allergic reaction to the materials, while Roger had to pull out due to deteriorating health.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The best that Konrad was able to pull off was a clown, but that in itself wasn&apos;t exactly something that was hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad was about to call the whole thing off when he had struck gold with a Ukraine-based effects company. A small group with some talent, they proved to be the ideal candidate, willing to work at a much lower figure than Konrad was fully prepared to pay.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Score one for Team Sabrewulf.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, however, matters at the Sabrewulf estate continue to grow complicated and troubled. There was an uncanny and an increasingly oppressive air surrounding the castle, something that everyone living there became all-too aware of.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Although sound proofing had been finally implemented and the creature was tied down tightly, that didn&apos;t stop Spinal from being a nuisance. Konrad had been experiencing horrible nightmares, the likes of which he never wanted to mention to Jurgen. Often in the dead of night he would hear footsteps and Spinal&apos;s distinctive cackle somewhere out on the roof or in the hallway just outside his door, sometimes in the walls.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Some times Spinal would just loom over him while he lied there on the bed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The worst were the bodies or body parts.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When Konrad awoke one morning, the first thing he had noticed was an odor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Opening his eyes, he let out a startled scream, causing Dieter and Jurgen to burst into his room and recoil with horror.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Around the bed were five bodies that were either gruesomely flayed or disemboweled, suspended in the air with ropes and poised like obscene marionette dancers, with countless arms, limbs and offal piled indelicately on counters.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;None of them had any heads. It was an awful experience that took countless hours to clean. Dieter had gotten rid of the bodies, though he made no mention where or how, nor had Konrad felt like inquiring any further about that.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Instead, his focus was more on other matters such as whose bodies they had belonged to. A thorough search and headcount of household staff revealed no missing servant or guard, nor were there any news items about missing persons, further deepening the mystery. Since then, Konrad and the others kept their eyes and ears open.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Further attempts at communication revealed that the creature knew thousands of languages, <text:soft-page-break/>notably Swedish, Japanese, Spanish, Hebrew, and Italian along with numerous dead languages such as Aramaic, Latin, Nubian, Chane, Akkadian, Egyptian, Acroa, Numidian, Chorotega, Ba-Shu, Favorlang and so on, although the entity seemed incapable of forming complete dialogue in any one. A lot of it was just mindless incomprehensible gibberish, but more often than not the creature just made a series of grunts, squawks, roars and other abnormal noises.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ferris continued to be as charming and vitriolic as ever.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Researchers were growing increasingly restless and uneasy, especially in the midst of the nonstop vile threats that he uttered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Several of them had threatened to quit.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Others reported suffering from dizzy spells, fainting, tanning, heat exhaustion and heat stroke, forcing Konrad to build a specially designed hallway with a lead-lined, shock and heat proof chamber all the way down at the end to put them at ease, complete with sound proofing so that Ferris&apos; disgusting voice could be drowned out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;More complications arose with Ferris than with Spinal, surprisingly; whatever transformation the mercenary had undergone had granted him abilities that no one was able to account for, including the ability to emit large pillars of fire, flight, enhanced strength as well as turning himself into a flying fireball.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Even more, Ferris was somehow able to bend light, rendering himself practically invisible to the human eye, as well as phase through walls, making him a nightmare to contain. Several had been either injured or killed in their efforts to prevent his multiple escapes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Research into his organic composition revealed that his entire being was encapsulated beneath a fiery plasma that occasionally emitted orange ribbons like solar flares.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Beneath this plasma was a thin translucent &quot;skin&quot; that both protected and sustained the rest of the body, although it seemed to be in a state of nonstop decay and regeneration all at the same time. All the fat within Ferris&apos; body had shrivelled into an emaciated frame underneath. Due to the self-sustaining nature of his condition, the mercenary had no need to use a washroom or to eat; in theory, it&apos;s possible that he could live for a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long time. Plans were underway to develop a protective suit and mask to keep him stable.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Further complications arose in Gupte&apos;s lab.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Herr Baron, but there is nothing more I can do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared at Gupte.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But surely there must be something that can be done!&quot; he insisted. &quot;Couldn&apos;t you treat my condition in the same way one treats Sickle Cell Anemia?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Gupte shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m afraid it&apos;s not as simple as that, Herr Baron,&quot; she said. &quot;If your file had been made accessible to the rest of the Medical Community our chances of finding other options would have been much better, but given our current situation...again, there&apos;s only so much I can do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat tightened his fist. Damn it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wish that I had better news.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So do I,&quot; growled Konrad.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The door to Gupte&apos;s office flung open.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Schneider, what the hell is the matter with you?!&quot; Gupte demanded. &quot;Can&apos;t you see I&apos;m busy with someone important?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Herr Doctor, but we have a situation,&quot; Schneider said. &quot;The creature in the dungeon is acting strangely!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Getting up from her chair, Gupte followed him out the door along with Konrad and Jurgen. When they approached the cell door, Konrad watched as they peered inside, then stood up to see what the fuss was all about.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Lying on the floor with rotting skin, the cobra had curled itself into a ball. Beneath the hood, tiny shriveled arms trembled while further down its tail were a pair of thin pink legs. The creature thrashed its tail about violently and started to writhe.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is happening to it?&quot; Jurgen asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it&apos;s going through death throes,&quot; Gupte replied. &quot;The change to its body must be too much for it to handle. It&apos;ll be only a matter of time before it stops completely.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Watching the creature convulse on the floor sickened Konrad. &quot;Can someone just get in there and kill the damn thing already?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wouldn&apos;t recommend it, Herr Baron, it&apos;s fourteen feet long. A person could get hurt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The creature banged mindlessly against the floor and wall.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad growled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh, fuck this,&quot; he said as he got out his cellphone. &quot;Dieter, I&apos;m by the downstairs cell. Get your ass down here.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When Dieter and Roger arrived, Konrad waved them over.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&apos;s going on?&quot; the former asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The creature you transported here is dying,&quot; he simply said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter shrugged. &quot;Not my fault.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein, I didn&apos;t say it was,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;The problem, however, is that the creature isn&apos;t dying quickly enough. So, I want you and Roger to get in there and put it out of its misery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Roger blanched at the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have got to be kidding.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wish I were.&quot; Came the grave response.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fuck,&quot; he said. Taking in a deep breath, he exhaled, then nodded. &quot;Alright, let&apos;s get this over with.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking out his Beretta, he nodded to Schneider, who then got out the keys for the cell door and unlocked it. Throwing the door open, the researcher backed away quickly, making room for both bodyguards as they stepped through.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter studied the creature. It was much bigger than he remembered. He also didn&apos;t remember it having legs.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He gave a questioning glance in Konrad&apos;s direction.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Baron&apos;s only response was a shrug.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Raising his sidearm, Dieter stepped to the twitching and convulsing serpentine mess, then glanced about the cell.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He had to be careful where he fired, otherwise the shot could ricochet and someone could get hurt.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The best way to properly do this, he reckoned, was by doing it low and aiming the weapon up toward the ceiling next to its eye or in its mouth, thereby blowing its brains out. It&apos;ll be messy, but less chance of there being collateral damage. Currently, the creature was lying on its back, its belly up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter took a slow and cautious step forward when the creature rolled back onto its belly, facing the wall opposite him. The snake&apos;s body started to ripple.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He watched as all the bones and muscles started to restructure themselves beneath its skin, all of it just as awful to see as it was to listen to.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Every reconfiguration of bone was accompanied by an audible pop and crack, every reformation of muscle by a squelch.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As the creature changed and expanded, it urinated, producing an unholy stench that made Dieter&apos;s eyes water and Roger give looks of disgust.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It then started to shit, releasing a foul black oily substance all over the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A new sound accompanied the horrible noises as the creature&apos;s skin started to violently tear itself apart.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The tiny shrivelled arms that hung beneath the &quot;hood&quot; have now become massive, powerful arms with huge biceps and deltoids while the legs became more muscular.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pushing itself off the floor, the creature shakily rose up on its newly formed legs onto its <text:soft-page-break/>tiptoes, towering over the two bodyguards, its tail flicking around in the air, waving off dead skin around the room, causing both men to duck and stare in horrified wonder.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter watched as the musculature on its back rippled, stiffened and tore violently through its dead skin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Staring up at the ceiling with its mouth open, trembling all over, the creature suddenly elicited a loud, guttural roar with its newly formed lungs and vocals that made the bodyguards flinch.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It was a deafening and unearthly sound, like the squawk of a parrot and nails on a chalkboard played through a filter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Lowering down its head, the creature shook itself like a dog, tossing free all of its remaining skin everywhere, pelting every corner and direction, including the bodyguards as they tried covering their eyes. Looking disgustedly at the dead skin around him, Dieter couldn&apos;t help but be reminded of caterpillar cocoons.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;I wish that this had been just some goddamn butterfly,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought grimly. Just a nice, friendly beautiful butterfly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what he was staring at.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Orange in color with black stripes on its back and a yellow undersection, the creature was tall, a whopping seven footer that stood on its tiptoes, kind of like a dog. Proportionally, it was very humanoid, with a robust, heavily muscled torso, a very slim waist and sturdy muscular legs. The creature had retained its serpentine features, including its cobra hood, but the hood itself hung over the shoulders like a pair of wings or like a protective shell. In fact, the entire back itself seemed to have become a sort of scaly, heavily muscled and armored shell. The most human feature of the thing were its arms and hands; despite having only three fingers on each hand excluding an opposable thumb and having huge talons at the end of each digit, they looked remarkably human. Disturbingly human.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;And incredibly strong-looking - Dieter could easily imagine those arms and hands crushing someone or something in their grasp.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The worst feature were the feet of the damn thing - on each of the beast&apos;s four toes, including its dewclaw, were four enormous sickle-like talons. It was as if Freddy Krueger decided to build himself a dinosaur and this monstrosity was the result.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Fuck, that is what this thing has become!&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Dieter thought. A fucking dinosaur.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Completing the overall package, a long tail with a curiously sharp stinger at the end swished around behind the creature, sometimes hanging directly over itself, reminding Dieter of a scorpion.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As the creature lowered down its serpentine head, a forked tongue slipped out and flickered periodically as it nuzzled the dead skin, sniffing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;To his disgust, the creature then started to eat it, munching and crunching loudly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking to Roger, Dieter gestured with his eyebrows that it was time to leave. Backing out slowly, carefully avoiding any sort of noise, the bodyguards took their time and got out from the room. Grabbing the cell door, both men tried to push it back. A squeaky hinge made Dieter&apos;s heart stop, causing the creature to halt.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;With all pretense of stealth dropped, the bodyguards slammed the door into its frame. No sooner had they closed it when the reptilian creature gave a guttural roar and slammed back with a bang, knocking both men off their feet.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;RUN! EVERONE OUT!&quot; Dieter yelled as he and Michael hastily pushed themselves up and scurried away. &quot;EVERYONE, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;SCHNELL! SCHNELL!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mein Gott!&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron, we must get you out here,&quot; Jurgen said as he tried wheeling him away.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as the beast smashed its way through the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Researchers gave startled screams and were running for their lives as it charged after them, with personnel dropping clipboards containing notes, beakers, sensitive equipment, even test animals as <text:soft-page-break/>it pursued them through the hallway, with some ducking behind closed doors. From the other end of the long hallway, an animal handler ran up to the creature with a long rod-like control pole with a noose at the end, jabbing and yelling in its direction as it ducked back, snapping with its jaws at the noose while another handler snuck up behind and lassoed it around the neck. Snarling, the creature turned to face him as the other handler hooked his pole around its neck. The men struggled violently to reign it in until they both were suddenly whisked right off off their feet as it reared itself back, throwing them aside as if they were mere toys. Clawing off the nooses, it stepped toward them hungrily.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;HEY! HEY!&quot; Dieter yelled, waving his arms at it. &quot;HEY FUCKFACE! OVER HERE!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning its ugly snake head to face him, the creature roared at him, revealing a series of sharp teeth along with a huge pair of viper-like fangs that dripped with venom.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jesus,&quot; the bodyguard blanched. Discharging his sidearm at the creature, Dieter bolted, narrowly avoiding having a chunk taken out from him by the animal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;GET ME A TRANQUILIZER GUN AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLILITERS OF THORAZINE!&quot; Gupte yelled to some researchers.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hearing her, the beast turned in their direction, then looked directly at Konrad. With four great strides it lunged toward the wheelchair bound figure just as he pushed his butler away. Grabbing hold of the beast&apos;s hungrily snapping jaws, Konrad threw the creature back with every bit of strength that he could muster back to the cell door, causing it to stumble back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Standing up from his seat, Konrad peeled off his cloak as everyone murmured around him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The beast gave a challenging growling hiss, baring its viper fangs, pawing the ground, producing sparks as its claws scraped noisily against it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad bared his own and roared back defiantly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The two charged one another, colliding together as Konrad tackled the beast into the cell, knocking both opponents off their feet.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Rolling around along the floor in a frenzy, Konrad tried to maintain dominance over it, but the creature beneath him was a good three hundred pounds heavier and stronger than he was, knocking him off balance as it climbed on top.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dodging to the side as it tried to bite him, the aristocrat grabbed a shackle that was chained to the wall and latched it onto one of the beast&apos;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The creature tried slashing at him with the shackled claw, only to be pulled back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking down at the chained limb, it started to scratch, claw and gnaw at the manacle like a captured coyote.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Using its distractedness as an opportunity, Konrad latched on the second manacle onto the other limb.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The beast struggled furiously in its bindings, letting out an infuriated roar, then darted its head down at him. Konrad grabbed its snapping bestial jaws, scowling as its hot acrid breath huffed into his face and as saliva and venom oozed down next him. Curling himself into a fetal position while he was on his back, he planted his feet onto the creature&apos;s ribs, then pushed it off with as much power as he could afford, tossing it back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Rolling away, Konrad scrambled quickly to his feet when something latched itself around his neck.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;HERR BARON!&quot; Jurgen yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Gasping, Konrad struggled for air, his eyes bulging as his clawed hands tried to pry the long tail off as it coiled around his throat.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The creature was slowly dragging him back toward it when Dieter, Jurgen and Roger grabbed hold, trying to unravel it from Konrad.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;GET THE DAMN THING OFF HIS NECK, IT&apos;S SUFFOCATING HIM!&quot; Jurgen yelled. &quot;ROGER, KILL THIS FUCKING THING ALREADY!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Got it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard raised his sidearm when the creature spat at him. Crying out, the bodyguard stumbled away.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;MY EYES! OH GOD IT BURNS!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;TAKE HIM TO THE SHOWERS!&quot; Gupte yelled to other researchers as she readied the tranquilizer gun. Aiming carefully, she steadied herself, then pulled the trigger. There came a muffled puff as a dart lodged itself into the creature&apos;s neck. Rearing up its head, it roared in surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad continued to struggle helplessly in its grip as it reeled him in like a fish caught on a hook.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not working!&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can see that, thank you!&quot; Gupte retorted as she loaded in another dart.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;HIT IT AGAIN!&quot; Jurgen yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;There came another muffled puff, this time, an identical twin dart wedged itself just right beside its sibling.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The creature continued unperturbed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad wheezed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;WHY WON&apos;T THIS FUCKER GO DOWN?!&quot; Dieter yelled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;For fuck&apos;s sake,&quot; Gupte said as she reloaded another.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Another dart appeared. It only slowed slightly. Konrad felt his face turning blue beneath his fur.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;HE&apos;S LOSING AIR! SCHNELL, DIETER, SCHNELL! HELP GET IT OFF!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad was starting to lose consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;STAY AWAKE, HERR BARON!

By the time it collapsed unconscious onto the floor, it had over a dozen darts protruding out from its body. Once Jurgen and Dieter finished unravelling its tail, Konrad took in a sharp breath of air, gasping and coughing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you okay, Herr Baron?&quot; The butler asked concernedly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nodding, the aristocrat wheezed and coughed for a while, then took long, slow, deep breaths. Looking at the researchers outside, his eyes narrowed at a particular individual. Pushing himself off the floor, he stormed angrily toward him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron?&quot; Jurgen said, puzzled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad continued toward the researcher, watching as his colleagues shrank away from him. Snatching the cellphone from his hand, he violently smashed it down onto the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the- MY PHONE!&quot; The man yelled as it was stomped into ruin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once he finished, Konrad lifted up his head, his gaze meeting the man&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How many times do you people need to be told?!&quot; He growled. &quot;NO! CELLPHONES! ALLOWED! There is no streaming! There is no Facebook! There is no Twitter, Tumblr, or any social media allowed on these premises, especially when you are at work! Article Two of your contract specifically states this. You are supposed to be a professional, so fucking act like it! Failure to comply will result in immediate termination, dismissal without pay and a lawsuit filed against you. Do you understand?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The man stared at him, his face pale.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He nodded vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You better.

We&apos;re lucky no one was killed by it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the animal has been contained, Herr Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what if it gets out again?!&quot; he demanded. &quot;Look at it, Gupte. It is not the same as it was before. It has become faster, stronger, and larger, with an appetite to boot. What if it breaks loose and eats someone?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will make sure that proper precautions are in place,&quot; Gupte promised. &quot;You won&apos;t have to spend any money, it will be on my tab.

Tell me, how do you plan on feeding it? This is a large animal, Herr Doctor, and judging by its reaction it&apos;s going to need a lot of energy to be kept properly fed. What do you plan to do, give it the odd intern when no one is looking? If that&apos;s the case, then I recommend starting off with that cellphone-using dipshit you have out there.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron,&quot; she said sternly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you also going to be to cleaning up after it as well?&quot; he pressed. &quot;Large animals tend to shit, Herr Doctor, in case you have forgotten, and they create one hell of a stench when left unattended.

The first time this was discovered, six people ended up <text:soft-page-break/>getting killed before the damn thing was finally subdued and returned back to its cell. Not even freezing temperatures had any sort of effect.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Further studies revealed other troubling news.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen and Dieter rolled Konrad into Gupte&apos;s office.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You wanted to see us,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The doctor nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I finished examining the animal,&quot; she said. &quot;You won&apos;t have to worry about it mutating further or getting five heads or wings as you had feared. Plus, I think I now have a plausible explanation for your condition, Herr Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m listening,&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I believe that your condition is the result of a retrovirus,&quot; she explained. &quot;A retrovirus, in case you don&apos;t know, is a type of RNA virus that inserts a copy of its genome into the DNA of a host cell that it invades, thus changing the genome of that cell. Unlike a regular virus, they contain an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which gives them the unique property of transcribing their RNA into DNA after entering a cell.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If my condition is the result of a virus-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Retrovirus,&quot;&lt;/em&gt; she corrected.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Retrovirus, then why is it that people aren&apos;t infected by me?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s not so unusual, Herr Baron,&quot; Gupte said. &quot;Certain retroviruses tend to be passed on through inheritance after infecting human cells. In your case, Herr Baron, it&apos;s unique. It is my belief that this particular retrovirus strain had not only transferred genetic material from its host, a wolf, onto one of your ancestors, but it had been passed down through your family for so long that those features that once made it viral in the first place have long become inert, possibly bred out with each successive generation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That could explain why the Baron doesn&apos;t infect anyone through bites or scratches,&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Does this mean that it&apos;s curable?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s possible, but unlikely,&quot; she answered regretfully.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Damn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Another complication with the animal came a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It had started with a phone call.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Answering his cell phone, Konrad heard Dieter&apos;s voice at the other end.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sir, we have a problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When Konrad entered Gupte&apos;s office with Jurgen, he saw Dieter and the doctor huddled over something.

When Dieter returned, he looked down at himself and at his shoes, buttoning up his coat as he left the cell.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s done,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I want you three to leave me alone for a moment,&quot; Konrad ordered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just do it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Jurgen, Dieter and Gupte walked away, Konrad continued staring into the cell. His shoulders sagging, he regarded its occupant pityingly, then gave a respectful and sorrowful nod in silence.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, the men sat at the dining room table, not saying a word to each other. Konrad took a long gulp of red wine, then refilled his glass. Jurgen made no effort to chastise him. Meanwhile, Dieter quietly smoked his cigarette, the fumes trailing off around him as the clock noisily counted down the hours to midnight.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;...Things are getting out of hand, Herr Baron.&quot; Jurgen spoke finally.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, thank you, Jurgen!&quot; Konrad growled from his seat in the dining room as he took another glass of wine.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what do you intend to do about it?&quot; Dieter demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If any of you have suggestions, now is the time to speak. I&apos;m all ears for any possible solutions.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;All three men fell silent.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Open up a theme park?&quot; Dieter said from across the table.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Be serious.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; the bodyguard replied, his brow curled in thought. &quot;Hm, this is a tough one. You could donate it to a zoo.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now you&apos;re being stupid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter,&quot; Konrad said in a restrained tone, &quot;do you honestly believe that any zoo out there is just going to take a dinosaur without asking questions?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You could just tell them that it&apos;s something found by one of your subsidiaries in Africa or South America.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;At which point I&apos;d be accused of wildlife smuggling and have Interpol along with other counter groups such as the Coalition Against Wildlife Trafficking on my ass,&quot; Konrad argued.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe it wouldn&apos;t have to be a zoo,&quot; Jurgen said. &quot;Do you remember that South African gentleman you met at one of those charity events years ago? The one that had his own private game reserve in Kenya?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad strained his mind trying to remember who it was the butler described.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh, I remember him,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Ferguson. Arrogant oaf of a man and a shit. I&apos;d rather be in conversation with Spinal than that half-wit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What about Lord Godfrey from Australia? He&apos;s a renowned fanatic of animals with his own private zoo. I heard that he&apos;s always searching for new species to add to his collection.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And illegally, or so the rumor goes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now&apos;s not the time to be picky,&quot; Dieter said matter of factly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can afford to be, especially when said-man had been suspected of financing terrorist organizations and rebel insurgencies in different countries.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What about that tycoon from Texas, Sheridan?&quot; Jurgen said. &quot;You&apos;re friends with him, Herr <text:soft-page-break/>Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Same problems as before, plus there&apos;s still the issue of the animal infecting people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How about just release it into the wild?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you insane?!&quot; Konrad roared. &quot;I&apos;m not going to do that!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No! Not here!&quot; Dieter said. &quot;I mean like in South America or Africa or wherever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And have it eat or infect some villager that has the misfortune of coming across it? I don&apos;t think so. A dinosaur running amok in Africa is bound to make headlines!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wouldn&apos;t be the first time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; Jurgen said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;In the Congo region there were reports of a brontosaurus. Locals called it Mokele...mokele...&quot; Dieter frowned. &quot;I don&apos;t know what the actual name is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;As interesting as that sounds, how do you propose transporting the animal and releasing it without anyone noticing and getting hurt, let alone killed?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard opened his mouth, then paused.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Damn.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You could always dump it off on some remote uninhabited island,&quot; Jurgen said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That definitely could work,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem with that, however, is not only finding a suitable site, but also finding a reason and opportunity for travelling to that region in the first place. I&apos;m pretty sure that the Board members and accountants would be puzzled. Even more, there&apos;s still the issue of transporting the damn animal unnoticed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It shouldn&apos;t be a problem,&quot; Dieter said. &quot;All we&apos;d have to do is just drug it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s assuming there&apos;s a drug powerful enough to keep it down. Even more, I&apos;m worried about it infecting other animals, even people should they stumble across it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen leaned back in his chair thoughtfully. &quot;What about...sealing up the creature in a steel container and dumping it in the deepest ocean trench? It along with Spinal, the mask and Ferris?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat tilted his chin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That&apos;s not a bad idea,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Very tempting, but there are so many ways that could go wrong. Potential discovery is a major issue. I highly doubt airport security are going to allow the containers to go through unchecked.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You could always bribe them.&quot; Dieter pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Which in turn would make Herr Baron vulnerable to blackmail and/or prison.&quot; Jurgen countered disapprovingly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even more,&quot; Konrad continued, &quot;there&apos;s a very strong possibility of their being stolen. Hell, people could mistakenly ship them to the wrong destination and in so doing unwittingly release them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even if they get lost en route or stolen,&quot; Dieter said, &quot;so what? Why not let someone else deal with them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what?!&quot; Konrad repeated. &quot;Dieter, people could get &lt;em&gt;killed&lt;/em&gt;! If someone dies due to Ferris&apos; homicidal rage, Spinal&apos;s bloodlust, or that animal&apos;s appetite, the police will be called in asking very uncomfortable questions and in turn trace their way back to this house!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron,&quot; the bodyguard said pointedly, &quot;do you want to get rid of these things or not?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know I do, Dieter, but I am not going to let people die as a result!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Suppose that everything ran smoothly,&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just suppose,&quot; Dieter cut him off. &quot;Suppose that during their transport I were to go along and supervise the whole thing. Would that bring some peace of mind?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;To an extent it would,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You doubt my ability? My loyalty?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You know I don&apos;t, Dieter,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Your talents are without question, of that there is no doubt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what&apos;s the problem?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Other factors. Suppose that everything does go according to plan. We dump the creatures into the deepest oceanic trench. Can we be &lt;em&gt;absolutely certain&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; would be present? Can we be sure that no one would find the containers, return them back to the surface or open them? How long would it be until someone stumbles upon them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just hear me out for a moment,&quot; Konrad insisted. &quot;Gupte&apos;s animal probably wouldn&apos;t survive the pressure or the cold temperatures of the ocean. However, Spinal doesn&apos;t have lungs, and his shield feeds on anything that makes contact with it. And then, of course, there&apos;s Ferris. Can the cold drown him, if not keep his temperature down? What if the pressure makes him implode? If he dies, he could either irradiate the water, killing off entire species of marine life and habitats, or he could go supernova and take out the fucking planet!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The three men quietly digested the facts.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Okay,&quot; Jurgen said, &quot;so we don&apos;t include Ferris in the plan. It&apos;s still manageable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But again, there&apos;s still the question of opportunity, witnesses, costs, and potential discovery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;There must be a way to get rid of these goddamn things,&quot; Jurgen said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, unfortunately, there isn&apos;t,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I refuse to believe that. There must be some way of dealing with them!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If I had my druthers, I&apos;d put them on a rocket and send them both into the sun. Can&apos;t do that now, can we?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A gleam shined in Dieter&apos;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Actually Baron, yes you can!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:line-break/></text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">11.

Although the hallway had been equipped with sensors and was kept at freezing temperatures, cold enough to make even Konrad himself shiver, he always felt apprehensive and alert whenever he came here. Beside him, Jurgen, Dieter and several researchers carrying fire extinguishers suspiciously eyed their surroundings, a few flinching at the slightest shadow. From behind the titanium door, Konrad heard nothing but the unmistakable crackling and sizzling of the thing&apos;s body, the unnaturally loud, harsh, pain-filled heaving of its breath that was amplified and distorted by the heat. It made no effort in demonstrating its rage - Konrad could practically feel it emanating from the door itself, even with it being shock and heatproof.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s been a while, Ben,&quot; Dieter called.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Ferris didn&apos;t answer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; Konrad whispered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Just let me handle it,&quot; the bodyguard said softly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He looked back to the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well?

Very problematic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;There was a moment of quiet contemplation.

Or gal.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as Dieter paused as he tried finding the proper words.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;He-&quot; the bodyguard cut himself off, then spoke again, &quot;His name is Spinal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;&apos;Spinal&apos;?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Ferris repeated mockingly. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;What&apos;s his last name, Column?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The only thing you need to know, Mr. Ferris,&quot; Konrad butted in, &quot;is that he&apos;s an&lt;em&gt; extremely&lt;/em&gt; dangerous individual and that he&apos;s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; indiscriminate in terms of who or what he kills. He murdered seven thousand or so people in a single night. Men, women, children, animals...If you and he were to meet, he would not hesitate for a second.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The mention seemed to have perked the mercenary&apos;s curiosity and interest.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Really?&lt;strong&gt;&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;he said.&lt;strong&gt; &quot;Huh.

If you destroy this particular relic for us, Spinal will no longer be an obstacle.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;And if I refuse?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad glowered at the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now isn&apos;t the time for games, Mr, Ferris,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Who said I was playing games?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; The infernal voice cooly replied. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Maybe I want this Spinal fella to come.

Humans have been using them for centuries. The Romans used elephants and pigs in their wars. We have used dogs, pigeons, dolphins, cats, rats...hell, DARPA has been doing stuff with insects.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But we&apos;re not talking about a dog or a beetle here, Dieter - this is a large predatory animal. Animals in general aren&apos;t exactly ideal weapons given their unpredictable nature. The CIA&apos;s &quot;Acoustic Kitty&quot; project is one such example,&quot; Konrad countered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;True, but given the presence of human genes in Gupte&apos;s beastie, in theory it&apos;s possible to domesticate it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what if it isn&apos;t? Hm? Even though chimps are ninety percent genetically similar to humans, that in itself doesn&apos;t mean that they&apos;re easily tamed. Even more, this animal possessing human DNA is also likely to create controversy, especially considering it had been done without the permission of a national ethics panel. I can&apos;t imagine watchdog groups like Human Genetics Alert just letting this slide.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, you could always file for one.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;For the last time, I will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use this animal, nor will I &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;, sell it as a weapon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But Baron, this creature is a goldmine waiting to be tapped!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And a highly virulent one!&quot; Konrad snapped. &quot;Even if domestication isn&apos;t an issue, I&apos;m more than certain that the Geneva Protocol wouldn&apos;t turn a blind eye to its ability to infect other species and not label it as some sort of bioweapon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron,&quot; Dieter said pointedly, &quot;this creature is too good an opportunity to pass off! Imagine, a weapon that can hunt and infect the enemy, creating more like it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what would we do with these extra creatures?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Catch them,&quot; the bodyguard said simply.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Catch them,&quot; Konrad repeated. &quot;And those after them? And those after? And those after? The way I see it, that would be more than a financial headache!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, when too many become a problem you could have some sort of incendiary or explosive device implanted into some of them, thereby keeping them in check should there be too many.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh that&apos;s a lovely idea!&quot; Konrad said sarcastically. &quot;Mail-order dinosaurs that are wired up with explosives! Every time a person has to make a call or press on their car alarm, pop goes a raptor! No possible way &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; could go wrong!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps you could have a clean-up crew to liquidate them. Bomb them out after they did their work. Plenty of ways to handle it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what if civilians get caught in the crossfire?! What if some child gets eaten live on television or worse transforms before horrified audiences?&quot; Konrad demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Collateral damage is to be expected in warfare,&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, but even I have enough sense to realize that public opinion can be used against us!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, you could always create PA ads or propaganda material to alleviate and address those concerns, maybe show how the good outweighs the bad.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And where will it end, Dieter?!&quot; Jurgen spat. &quot;Suppose that everything goes according to plan <text:soft-page-break/>and this is all approved. Where will it end?! People already have enough troubles in the world. Hatred for hatred, blades for blades, bullets for bullets, bombs for bombs, and now you are proposing to add another horror in the amphitheater of war, one that could lay foundations for future horrors.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everything has consequences,&quot; Dieter replied evenly. &quot;Especially in doing nothing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He straightened himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The thing, Baron, is that you don&apos;t have a choice, unfortunately. The reality of your situation is that as long as Gupte&apos;s animal is still alive, eating, shitting and breeding, it&apos;s going to cost you house and home. You are having enough troubles just trying to find a cure. And that&apos;s not even going into the potential costs for Spinal, Ben or Glacius. Or in maintaining your home with all the labs, personnel and equipment. So, if I were you, I&apos;d think long and hard about this before being dismissive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter rolled his neck.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s easy to get caught up in the bad, but who knows? Perhaps with this creature&apos;s introduction into the world it will help advance medicine and technology,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad sat there quietly, digesting his points.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I will take your proposal under consideration,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;but I have an alternative solution for this - we force the creatures to fight in the Killer Instinct tournament.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron, surely you can&apos;t be serious,&quot; Jurgen said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I am,&quot; Konrad affirmed. &quot;We use the tournament as a way of hiding their existence. To the rest of the world, it will all be men in suits, CGI and special effects, and we will carefully tailor everything to show that to be as such. If they happen to escape and/or someone somehow catches footage of them, perhaps even deciding to post them online on sites such as YouTube, we can negate that by copyright-claiming their footage or by issuing a cease and desist.

In front of the two men, a shaft of green light erupted from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter glanced up, startled.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Keep quiet,&quot; Konrad whispered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Inside the cell, the serpentine creature stirred, its slit eyes narrowing as it gave a low growling hiss in warning.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;From the ether, a chillingly low disembodied voice spoke one word in invocation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSSSSSPIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNAAAAAAAAALLLLLL!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;From the green inferno on the floor, a cutlass-wielding bony hand pushed up into the air as the rest of the creature emerged, its skeleton reconfiguring before the duo, roaring at the cell&apos;s captive. Inside, the serpent raised itself from the floor and roared back, baring its monstrous viper-like fangs in challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kill it,&quot; Konrad commanded quietly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once that command had been given, Spinal took two jerky halting steps forward, then burst into a run on the third, maniacally laughing as he charged. The two creatures clashed violently with each <text:soft-page-break/>other, the battle long and brutal as they wrestled each other for dominance, with Spinal repeatedly stabbing into the serpent and the serpent biting, clawing and spitting wildly at him before it was pushed back. Roaring in frustration at being confined by its manacles, the serpent launched itself into the air and curled itself into a ball, slamming itself down onto Spinal like a wrestler before springing back up like a kangaroo, its hind feet knocking the skeleton off the floor against the wall. As it did so, the chains snapped from the wall.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Shit, it&apos;s managed to get itself loose from the chains!&quot; Dieter said in alarm.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Keep shooting,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Come on, Spinal, kill this goddamn thing already!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Spinal struggled to get back up as the creature pressed a clawed foot on his chest. As the serpentine maw came down to bite down on his head, he disappeared in a column of green light, taking it with him as they both reappeared, the two creatures crashing down violently on the floor beside each other. Recovering, the two resumed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Konrad had seen all manner of fighting, be it in tournaments, on the streets or in movies. Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, T.J. &quot;Combo&quot; Garret - all had been absolutely magnificent to watch, but what Konrad saw before him was beyond anything he&apos;d ever seen or experienced. There was nothing balletic or graceful about either the fighters or their movements, it was just frantic, bloody mindless chaos. Time had been rewound several million years back, before rationality and intellect were born, when tooth and claw were the only rules available.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad wanted desperately to look away, but part of him was mesmerized and enthralled by it all, which in turn made his stomach churn in horror and self-disgust.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Before him, both creatures were the worst for wear; Spinal&apos;s bones were fractured in places with a few teeth missing while his serpentine opponent was covered in various cuts, oozing purple blood freely. Both unsteady on their feet, they took turns swiping at each other, lasting only a few minutes before the serpent collapsed unconscious onto the floor. Tossing his head back, Spinal&apos;s laugh echoed off the cell walls.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;He got it!&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as the animal&apos;s side heaved.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kill it,&quot; he ordered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning around to face him, Spinal gave him a mocking hateful look.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come on,&quot; he demanded. &quot;I said finish it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The skeleton stepped toward its fallen opponent, staring down at it, tilting its head, quirking its jaw. Putting his sword down against a wall, he then bent toward the animal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad blinked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hoisting the serpent up, Spinal then draped the unconscious animal off of his bony shoulders like some sort of scarf or coat, then started to strut proudly around, appreciating and petting his newfound &quot;garment&quot;. *&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stood there gawking in disbelief while Dieter howled with laughter as the skeleton moved into various poses like a fashion model, staring down at itself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Meh,&quot; Spinal shrugged as he then casually tossed the creature off his shoulders onto the floor in an indelicate heap.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Alright,&quot; Konrad said amidst Dieter&apos;s chuckles. &quot;You had your fun, now finish it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The skeleton just stood there. Konrad was starting to lose patience.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I said finish it!&quot; he commanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Spinal picked back up its cutlass, then raised it over its head. At that exact moment, the animal sprung back to consciousness, lashing out with its tail, tripping the skeletal warrior. Pushing itself unsteadily up, the serpent stared down at its opponent, then, with a mighty swing down from its tail, crushed his skull into tiny pieces. Rearing up its head, the serpent let out a primal roar in victory before lowering it back down to face Konrad and Dieter themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;This isn&apos;t good,&quot; the latter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The serpent took a step toward them both, then started to charge.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Konrad and Dieter flew forward and slammed the cell door shut, barely having enough time to lock it as the animal battered away to get to them, letting out daemonic howls of frustrated fury and hunger. After several attempts to get out, there came a loud snort, followed by a hiss.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Goddamn, that thing is tough!&quot; Dieter commented.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hn.&quot; grunted Konrad.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Beside them, a green aura appeared on the floor. Konrad watched as Spinal pulled himself out from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What do you say, Baron?&quot; Dieter asked. &quot;Do you want to try again?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;I don&apos;t like the odds, especially with the animal loose in its cell. We&apos;ll need someone to tranquilize it and fix its chains as soon as possible - it&apos;s a fucking disaster waiting to happen.

I&apos;ll talk to you later. Auf Wiedersehen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chairman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Konrad hung up his phone, suspicion crept into the corner of his mind, followed by a sinking feeling.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;What are you playing at, Herr Doctor?&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he wondered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As time passed by, further developments continued to be made at the Sabrewulf household.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad had spent some time putting together a team for Project Fulgore along with some design plans for the machine itself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Candidates were thoroughly screened and forced to sign contracts in order to ensure secrecy, especially when it came to the anomalies living under his roof. Looking at the notes for the Kilgore project, Konrad felt a certain level of distaste for its design.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A crude, ball-jointed thing with a bulky head with some loose wires at the back, the Kilgore prototype had no facial features save for a glowing red cyclopean eye, a red straight line that was indelicately placed at the center of a helmet. Konrad wasn&apos;t eager to repeat that design detail.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He wanted this newest machine to stand out and take peoples&apos; breaths away.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking some cues from the Theseus androids and some of the armor in his castle, Konrad determined to make it a follow-up of sorts to the former; in the same way the Theseus androids were made to resemble Greek hoplites, Project Fulgore would resemble a medieval knight, complete with a helmet plume. Unfortunately, Mathison, the project director that Konrad had selected personally for the project, had been less than enthused about the idea and insisted on drawing inspiration from Japanese ninjas, making the design lithe and agile-looking with a ponytail and a pair of kage claws on its wrists, arguing that it would inspire intrigue. Konrad argued against it, pointing out that having the machine designed after a medieval knight would inspire feelings of assurance and safety. The two butted heads with each other over its design, at one point threatening to come to blows. Once they took some time to cool down, a compromise was made. As a result, Project Fulgore incorporated elements from both.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;In order to increase Project Fulgore&apos;s chances of success, much effort was made in studying the enigmatic relationship between Homo Glacies and its metallic biomechanical shell. There was a great deal of overlap between the various projects; by researching Project Cinder&apos;s ability to phase through walls and objects, for example, were the researchers able to properly research Spinal&apos;s methods of transport and its energy source. Meanwhile, extensive studies had been carried out on Spinal&apos;s ability to somehow channel heat into its blade along with Cinder&apos;s ability to turn invisible, with both properties then incorporated into Project Fulgore. Research into both creatures in turn led to decoding more of Homo Glacies&apos; genetic code, but after several impressive strides forward they hit a roadblock in the form of several more protein chains and impenetrable cell wall structures that left even the most brilliant biologists amongst Konrad&apos;s researchers stumped.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Konrad&apos;s dreams continued to worsen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Every night was some horrible experience that made him wake up in cold sweats and nausea, and no matter what he did, whether it was having a glass of milk or water, exercise or reading a book, it brought nothing but terror. It became such that he had to take sleeping pills.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;In his dreams, Konrad was back at the arena, back when Spinal made his horrible debut and had summoned that massive beast, but what made these dreams particularly terrifying was that Konrad had witnessed it all from the perspective of the consumed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As its maw opened, Konrad was slowly dragged alongside the other audience members.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Men, women and children were screaming and crying as they were forcibly moved into the creature&apos;s gullet by dead security guards and strange shadowy figures that resembled winged faceless humanoids with horns. No matter how much he struggled, Konrad was unable to break free from his captives.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Usually it would have been around here that he would burst wide awake in a panic, but each night he found himself drawn closer and closer until he descended, where he saw a great, sprawling, tenebrously desolate and alien landscape that was cloaked in perpetual shadow. What light existed in certain places was unnatural in color, with flames that either glowed a strangely lemon green or a harsh crimson.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once everyone had been taken, Konrad bore witness to all manner of unspeakable horrors; in his dreams, the audience members were being hollowed out by the shadow figures, their various organs removed, devoured, used for blasphemous arcane rituals while their various parts were used to build shrines and temples, even other bizarre creatures. The leftover skins and bones themselves became nothing more than bodysuits for these beings.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Amidst all this horror, Konrad sensed something.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It was subtle at first, but as the dreams progressed in their intensity, the more Konrad became aware of some sort of presence that lurked somewhere in the background beyond his periphery, never in full view, although he might catch a glimpse from the corner of his eye. Multiple presences, in fact. Despite never having a clear view of anything, the aristocrat had sensed something enormous brush past him. It almost felt as if it had reached out for him before abruptly stopping and pulling away. Once he felt it leave, Konrad awoke screaming.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When morning came, Konrad stared tiredly down at his breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You look terrible, Herr Baron,&quot; Jurgen said as he poured him a fresh cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve been having trouble sleeping,&quot; the aristocrat replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it those nightmares again?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have to do something about this, Herr Baron&quot; he said. &quot;This is not normal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, I&apos;m quite aware of that, thank you,&quot; Konrad said bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps you should seek help from a therapist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Herr Baron, you&apos;ve been waking up screaming!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know that!&quot; he said in frustration.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So why not get professional help?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because I don&apos;t want to be called crazy!&quot; Konrad retorted. &quot;You don&apos;t think something like this wouldn&apos;t affect my position at the company?

I&apos;d be forced to resigned!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well,&quot; Jurgen said slowly, &quot;perhaps it would be better if you had.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad glared at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ohhh, I see,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it comes out. I see what you&apos;re doing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Jurgen demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You don&apos;t think I know what you&apos;re trying to do?!&quot; Konrad said angrily. &quot;This isn&apos;t about concern for my health, it&apos;s jealousy!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t be ridiculous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;AM I?!&quot; Konrad roared. &quot;You&apos;ve always been jealous of me, Jurgen! Always! Ever since we were children you despised me for having wealth! You wanted everything I had, but you couldn&apos;t! You hated that you and your family were servants to mine! You might try to pass yourself off as some sort of Mother Theresa, the &quot;&lt;em&gt;generous&quot;&lt;/em&gt; hard-done-by saint who asks and wants for nothing, but the truth is you couldn&apos;t be happier and ask for more! You &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; having power over me! You &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; having the knowledge that I am vulnerable and under your thumb! You &lt;em&gt;don&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; want to see me recover, NO! You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to see me ruined! It gives you pleasure seeing me being screwed over again and again and again! DON&apos;T YOU DENY IT!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen stonily stared at the Baron.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How dare you?&quot; he said lowly. &quot;After all these years, how can you say such cruel things? If I really had wanted to see you ruined, why didn&apos;t I report some of your outrageous behaviour? Wasn&apos;t I always there when you needed me?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Someone play me a violin,&quot; Konrad retorted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The butler stood there for a long time, not saying a word.

Ducking down as it crashed, Jurgen kept low as the Baron tossed the other items from his tray, pelting him with toast, bacon and eggs before more items crashed noisily around him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the hell is going on here?!&quot; Dieter said as the door opened, ducking quickly as a salt shaker smashed just a few feet above his head. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You are a lunatic, Herr Baron!&quot; Jurgen said heatedly. &quot;A goddamn lunatic!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;GET OUT!&quot; Konrad roared.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Jurgen slammed the door behind them, the aristocrat sat there on the bed, his form trembling with anger. Looking down at his clenched fists, he casts his eyes around. He wanted to hit something. Anything. Anyone. Getting up, he checked around for a bottle of alcohol. Letting out a stream of curses in German, he kicked the mattress, then collapsed back down.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Christ I wish I had a drink.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Later, Konrad sat in his office, studying the Tibetan scroll and statue. He squinted at the markings, trying to make heads or tails of the writing. A knock sounded at the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come in,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He watched as Dieter stepped inside.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Something you need?&quot; Konrad asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No, not really,&quot; the bodyguard replied. &quot;Just checking up.

I&apos;ve never seen him so angry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He grunted in acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking curiously at the items on his desk, Dieter eyed them.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what are you doing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nothing much,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;I&apos;m trying to decipher the writing on this, but there&apos;s a problem.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what&apos;s that?&quot; Dieter asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t speak or read Tibetan.&quot; he answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter looked at him the moment he said that.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;But...if you hadn&apos;t known, how did you know that those items were real?&quot; he queried.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The same way I knew that mask was authentic, Dieter - I felt something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you tried asking Tyler to translate it?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Zhou doesn&apos;t speak Tibetan, unfortunately,&quot; Konrad replied. &quot;Only Mandarin, Cantonese, English and Thai.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh,&quot; Dieter said simply.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat eyed him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t suppose you know Tibetan, per chance?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sorry, Baron,&quot; Dieter shook his head. &quot;Only Asian language I know is Thai.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad blinked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Really?&quot; he said interestedly. &quot;I never knew that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah.&quot; The bodyguard said as he took out a cigarette. &quot;I picked it up from an ex-girlfriend named Sadira.

No doubt many of you have heard about geneticists such as J. Craig Venter wanting to create pigs with human organs or humanized mice. Or how in 2007 scientists created sheep that were fifteen percent human, or the Chinese researchers in 2011 that genetically modified cows to produce milk that is akin to human breast milk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes, yes, we&apos;re all familiar with them,&quot; David said impatiently. &quot;What does this have to do with Project Riptor?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot actually. Several months ago, I came upon a newly discovered strain of retrovirus, labelled in my notes as SW-G1-28,&quot; Gupte said. &quot;Before I could investigate it fully, an incident had occurred; one of the animal handlers had forgotten to secure one of the cages containing live cobras, and as a result, one of them escaped and consumed mice infected with this retrovirus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;People murmured amongst themselves as she showed them pictures via projector.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Roughly an hour after consumption, the subject started to change, expanding in size and had consumed the others, even going so far as to develop forearms. Two weeks later, it developed a pair of legs. A month later, it became bipedal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Board members gasped as Gupte showed them the latest photo.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;My god,&quot; one breathed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Look at the size of that thing!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David stared at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why the hell weren&apos;t we informed of this sooner?!&quot; he demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Gupte wiped her glasses.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I needed to investigate further in order to determine the potential hazard it represented.&quot; she answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it dangerous?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Very.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Am I crazy or do parts of it look human?&quot; Sacket asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The doctor nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed it does,&quot; she said. &quot;The retrovirus has inserted human DNA into its genetic code and has modified it considerably.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Human?&quot; David repeated, puzzled. &quot;Why would it have human DNA?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared at the screen in alarm.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A working theory I have is that human contamination had occurred when the mice were being handled,&quot; Gupte said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The explanation seemed to satisfy the Board members, causing Konrad to quietly sigh in relief.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Were the mice already infected with this thing, or did you infect them yourself?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;The former.&quot; Gupte answered before moving on. &quot;Following its mutation, &quot;RIPTOR&quot; developed several new traits. Not only is it highly adaptable, able to resist freezing cold temperature and extreme heat, but it can spit highly concentrated venom. It also has immense strength, agility, a remarkably high intelligence and possesses considerable regenerative capabilities unlike anything <text:soft-page-break/>I&apos;ve ever seen. Even more, it can reproduce asexually.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;People looked around and chattered nervously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;How do we know any of this is real?&quot; David demanded. &quot;How do we know this isn&apos;t some sort of joke?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Without saying a word, Gupte bent down and picked up a bag. As she opened it up, Konrad grimly watched as she placed five leathery eggs on the table.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You may examine them, if you wish,&quot; she said. &quot;Just be very careful with them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared at the scene as people passed the eggs around, poking and feeling them. One or two hesitated while another downright refused to touch them.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David quietly regarded the eggs.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did the Chairman know about this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Gupte shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was awfully risky to have kept this a secret,&quot; David said. &quot;It&apos;s a wonder no one had gotten hurt or killed if it&apos;s as dangerous as you had suggested.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have there been any incidents?&quot; Sacket asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It tried to escape several times, but thankfully no one has gotten hurt,&quot; she answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Is it infectious?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Tests with other animals reveals that it is through scratches from its claws. I&apos;m currently looking into developing an antidote for it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what of SW-G1-28?&quot; Konrad asked. &quot;I thought I heard something about a patent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It is true,&quot; Gupte confirmed. &quot;I have applied for a patent and hope to make a new cell line using it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t like this,&quot; David said. &quot;This has litigation written all over it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mindful of the potential harm &quot;RIPTOR&quot; may have, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Gupte said, &quot;you have to consider the benefits of this discovery. Think about it for a second - the first ever reptilian/human chimera, a creature that has newly formed, never-before-seen proteins in its venom, with a genetic code that has the potential to revolutionize modern medicine and allow for unprecedented advances in cross species genetics! Money can be made from this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even so,&quot; David said, &quot;there would still be the issue of what to do with this thing. After all, it is an animal that needs to be fed and looked after.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps we could breed it and sell it as part of a lineup for genetically modified pets,&quot; One of the Board members suggested. &quot;There is a market for such. Even more, if we were to alter traits of the animal&apos;s young during their development, perhaps give them different colors, different color patterns, different appearances, different sizes, different behaviours, we could attract a wider audience. What person wouldn&apos;t want to design their very own dinosaur? And that&apos;s not even thinking about food, clothing and accessories.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;That could potentially work.&quot; he replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Gupte gave them both an incredulous stare.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Surely you two aren&apos;t serious!&quot; she exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We most certainly are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Kellog, this is a dangerous animal, not a poodle!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And presumably it&apos;s possible to domesticate it, if not alter its genetics and its offspring so that they wouldn&apos;t be infectious.&quot; David said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, ja, but-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why settle for&lt;em&gt; just&lt;/em&gt; the pet market?&quot; One of the Board members interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And what do you have in mind, Ms. Chambers?&quot; David asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Tilting her head in thought, Chambers ran her fingers along her chin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Taking into consideration some of the military applications of it, I can see this animal as being &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; valuable, especially to DARPA,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;You have got to be joking,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Making money isn&apos;t a laughing matter,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ms. Chambers,&quot; David said slowly, &quot;how can this animal possibly be utilized?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;By going places that your combat androids couldn&apos;t,&quot; Chambers said matter of factly. &quot;It is common knowledge that the maintenance work and upkeep for them is a nightmare to deal with, especially in harsh terrain. If this animal is as intelligent and as adaptable as Gupte suggests, then it will be the perfect answer to our problems. No sand or damp would disable or short circuit it, nor will it freeze up and lock into place when it suddenly becomes too cold. Plus, it is self-sustaining. Even if it gets killed, it can infect the enemy and create more like it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David raised his eyes up the moment she said that.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;And how will it exactly know who or what is an enemy?&quot; he said. &quot;What will prevent it from eating civilians?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A combination of training, conditioning and shock collars,&quot; Chambers answered. &quot;Condition the animal to recognize certain sounds, words or frequencies that will give it the order to attack or to halt. Perhaps even train it to follow commands, to work with a squad or platoon of soldiers or track targets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;This cannot be happening,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Gupte did NOT just go behind his back to reveal this monstrosity before the Board, and Chambers was NOT proposing this travesty of an idea. But no matter how hard he tried denying, there wasn&apos;t any escape from what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;David sat quietly at the table. Lifting his head up in contemplation, Konrad saw gears moving around in his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think it is a horrible idea,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Bless you, David,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad thought. He may be a sycophantic blowhard, but at least he had sense.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;However,&quot; he continued, &quot;it might not be that much of a stretch to imagine that some government will eventually decide to use this animal and its ilk for military purposes, so we should look into that as a potential avenue to explore. All in all, I think this could be a potential rainmaker.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;I stand corrected,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Konrad bitterly thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Should we consider the idea of taking SW-G1-28 and applying it to other species?&quot; One of the Board members asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad opened his mouth to protest when David spoke, &quot;One step at a time, Mr. Meyers. For now we have to deal with this creature first, although that could be a topic to discuss at our next meeting.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He then looked around.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;All those in favor?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad watched as all of the Board members raised their hands in the air.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;All those against?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;None voted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What say you, Mr. Chairman?&quot; David said expectantly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When Jurgen entered the Baron&apos;s room, he saw the aristocrat seated on his bed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Your supper is almost ready, Herr Baron,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad made no indication of having heard him.

You could have just said &quot;no&quot; and ended it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But either way I would still be stuck with the damn thing, Jurgen!&quot; Konrad retorted as he pulled his hand away. &quot;Even if I just let it rot in that cell, it&apos;s still going to be there, and if the failed attempts on it were any indication, it isn&apos;t going to die anytime soon!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So the best thing to do is to market and sell it?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I didn&apos;t have a choice!&quot; Konrad said. &quot;I know it is a mistake.

It wasn&apos;t just the flatness in his voice that bothered him, but also the look of disappointment that he gave.

Konrad had let Jurgen down.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Why didn&apos;t I just say no?&lt;/em&gt;&apos; he thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He&lt;em&gt; was &lt;/em&gt;the majority shareholder - his vote had the most impact.

That animal &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; die, Gupte. I don&apos;t care how, I don&apos;t care how many times I&apos;ll have to try, but it will die.

Lives will be ruined as family members are devoured before their children&apos;s frightened eyes, assuming they themselves survive long enough to avoid being either food or turned. Assuming that the children&lt;em&gt; themselves&lt;/em&gt; aren&apos;t the ones devouring them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The office was quiet, the two figures staring at each other, the air thick and heavy.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, what I&apos;m doing is cruel,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;but don&apos;t you even pretend for a moment that you are some infallible saint!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t you dare pin this on me, Herr Baron!&quot; Gupte said sternly. &quot;I wanted to use the creature <text:soft-page-break/>for medicine, for the good of humanity! It was &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; who approved its use as a weapon! So when you see all those bodies on TV in the future, remember that it was YOUR doing, not mine!

Dealing with the Baron in this state was like a game of Russian roulette - one never knew what to expect when he had too much to drink. Sometimes he&apos;d be incredibly merry, even goofy. Often the aristocrat would just be moody and suffer severe bouts of depression. There were times, however, when the drink would bring out the worst in him; the Baron would be volatile, quick to anger, even violent, hurling insults and whatever object he could get his hands on. While he himself never lashed out using his fists, thankfully, Konrad can be an absolute nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Raising up his hand, he knocked on the door.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Come in,&quot; Konrad slurred.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Opening the door, Jurgen saw the Baron seated on his bed, holding up a glass of wine. Beside him were four empty bottles.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, Jurgen!&quot; Konrad said cheerfully. &quot;Come in, come in!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Well,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Jurgen thought, &lt;em&gt;&apos;at least he&apos;s in a good mood.&apos;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;For now. He never let his guard down, though - when the Baron drank it&apos;s never certain how long this show of amiability would last before reverting to something else.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The butler slowly approached, keeping his eyes locked on him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Would you like a drink?&quot; Konrad drunkenly offered, spilling some on himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nein, thank you, Herr Baron,&quot; he refused.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat grunted, wiping himself clumsily with his forearm, then took a huge gulp.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Jurgen asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Drinking!&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Can&apos;t you see?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The lupine figure&apos;s shoulders slumped.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t know, Jurgen,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Sometimes I wonder if I&apos;m destined for failure.

When he got back, he found the Baron sprawled out on the bed, snoring loudly. Sighing, he placed the tray on a nearby counter and went over to the bed, taking away the bottle and glass cups. Grabbing hold of the blanket, Jurgen carefully tucked the Baron in, making sure as not to disturb him, then took the glasses and tray of food and quietly left the room, closing the door behind him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The next day, Konrad was in the attic massaging his temples while Dieter and several researchers dressed in lab coats holding clipboards set up cameras around Spinal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are the cameras ready?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yes sir.&quot; One of the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Good.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pulling his hand away, he took out the mask from his cloak pocket and waited as the bodyguard nervously untied Spinal.

Men, women, children, animals - whatever was imagined it could become instantly. Even some of the more outlandish forms that Konrad had in his head became physically manifested into corporeal form. But with this continued usage came a heavy toll; Konrad became mentally exhausted as he tried restraining the little bastard.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that will be all for now,&quot; Konrad said as he held up the mask. &quot;Return back to the table.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Scowling, Spinal stomped back and obeyed, lying back down as Dieter and the others tied it down.

Grabbing it, he took it to the bed and quietly plugged it in. Settling comfortably down with his back resting against a pillow and the headboard, Konrad clicked onto Google and went straight to YouTube. Typing into the search engine, he waited as the page loaded. Once the video by Harry Coswell appeared, Konrad clicked on it and played it again.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When morning came, Jurgen entered Konrad&apos;s room with a tray of breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re up early, Herr Baron,&quot; the butler commented.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve been up all night,&quot; Konrad replied, not looking up from his laptop.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Another bad dream?&quot; Jurgen asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Jurgen sighed as he approached the Baron.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Put the tray on the table beside me,&quot; the latter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Obeying, the butler gave him a curious glance.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Reading something interesting?&quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve been watching videos on YouTube and looking up information,&quot; Konrad replied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;About what, Herr Baron?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Harry Coswell,&quot; he answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Coswell?&quot; Jurgen repeated. &quot;Is that the one you described as a crackpot?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Indeed,&quot; Konrad answered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why this sudden interest in Coswell?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Lifting his eyes from the monitor to meet the butler&apos;s, Jurgen saw the tiredness in them, all veiny and drooping.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wanted to get in contact with him to see what else he knew,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Did he say anything?&quot; Jurgen asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn&apos;t able to get hold of him, unfortunately,&quot; the Baron replied. &quot;Apparently he had died shortly after making that YouTube video about Spinal months ago.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh dear.

Looking over the edge, he saw no bottom or ground, just an empty stretch of sky that extended into infinity. Raising his head to the sky itself, he saw no stars or moon, just clouds that moved far too quickly for his liking. The air thick and discolored with a yellowish haze like chalk or charcoal, he looked around on the floating platform, then stopped upon finding that he wasn&apos;t alone; ten silhouetted figures stood before him, watching. Opening his mouth, Konrad called to them, but for whatever reason he couldn&apos;t hear his own voice. Trying again, he started to yell. Nothing. No matter what he said, no matter how loud or how hard he tried, nothing came out. Frustrated, Konrad looked to see if the figures themselves had heard him, but nothing indicated that anything he said registered. Taking a couple steps forward, Konrad squinted his eyes through the thick yellow haze. He could just vaguely make out their outlines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three men and one woman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peering through the chalky haze, he tried making out the rest of their features, but it was difficult. Looking around to the rest, Konrad was startled at the sight of them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;RIPTOR was on the platform, uncaged and unchained, coiled up in serpentine fashion on the floor. Beside it stood Ferris, who stared directly at Konrad with hate-filled eyes as he continued to burn. Eagle was there, looking pale and dead, while Homo Glacies stoically watched him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As the wind howled in this bizarrely desolate space, Konrad heard a familiar insane laugh behind him. Turning around, he saw Spinal standing close to the edge with cutlass and shield in hand, laughing to himself. As he continued to cackle, a sound joined with his, causing Konrad to tremble furiously. It sounded like a voice, an impossibly deep, heavy, powerful baritone that rumbled through Konrad&apos;s own person and sounded like it had belonged to something outlandishly <text:soft-page-break/>gargantuan, echoing into the wind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following the direction from where the laugh came, Konrad and the others turned around and stared into the empty void ahead of them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rising up to a titanic height was an enormous tan-colored gargoyle, a thing that looked like a man born from a bat with a pair of enormous leathery wings on its back and tusks that jutted out from its lower lip. On its powerfully built humanoid torso was a concave head with a strong pronounced chin, a short nose, a pair of long pointed ears and a receding forehead, giving it a vaguely tiger-like countenance. Staring down at the figures beneath him with its horrible yellow lantern-like eyes, the creature pointed at them in mockery and laughed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To its left, another horror appeared, a massive ogre-like being with a club and a horned, split head with a pulsating brain. Its stomach horribly distended and bloated with gas, its skin rotting with exposed bone, the second obscenity joined its compatriots in its laughter, its cyclopean heads laughing and gurgling in conjunction with the others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clasping his hands to his ears to block out the cacophonous noise, Konrad watched as another horror appeared to the gargoyle&apos;s right, a massive humanoid creature with rotting skin, a featureless spiked studded ball for a head with long simian-like arms, one of them wrapped in chains and carrying a giant meat hook in its left hand. Vertebrate-like pieces of rusted metal jutted out from its back and a great spiked ring was wrapped around its torso.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning around to face Spinal, a fourth creature appeared, a towering humanoid figure with a mouthless, tentacled octopus-like face, numerous eyes and a pair of long mastodon-like tusks. At the sight of this newest apparition, Konrad opened his mouth to scream, but as he did so, the sound died down in his throat as it drew closer. Reaching out with its enormous hand, Konrad watched as it leaned in toward him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When he finished, Jurgen stared at the Baron.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I can see why you stayed up all night,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;That sounds absolutely terrifying.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was,&quot; Konrad nodded. &quot;And it still is when I think about it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Obviously your studies of the skeleton had influenced your dreams-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s more than that,&quot; Konrad interrupted. &quot;Do you suppose, Jurgen, that we were &lt;em&gt;meant&lt;/em&gt; to find Spinal?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What makes you say that, Herr Baron?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He tapped his index finger on the monitor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve been viewing some videos of the tournament,&quot; Konrad said. &quot;Watching them, the one thing that struck me was how riled up the audiences were, how they all seemed to revel in it. That was when it occurred to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What, Herr Baron?&quot; Jurgen asked.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad looked up at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Have you ever heard of Dionysus?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The butler shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dionysus,&quot; Konrad began, &quot;was the Greek god of the grape-harvest, wine and wine-making.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A deity after your own heart,&quot; Jurgen interjected.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad grunted in acknowledgement before continuing on, &quot;He was also, among other things, the god of theater, religious ecstasy, ritual madness and epiphany. For the Greeks, theater wasn&apos;t just some luxury - it was a ritual in honor of the deity. Suppose, Jurgen, that the reason why Spinal came to the arena was to hijack the tournament itself in order to make it into some kind of ritual? A violent ritual made for violent gods from other worlds, designed to further tether our own to theirs, or perhaps to put events into motion that in turn would allow for these beings to eventually come into our world?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The butler quietly digested this.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But if that&apos;s true,&quot; Jurgen said slowly, &quot;why hadn&apos;t there been anymore chanting when you had Spinal fight Gupte&apos;s animal?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because there wasn&apos;t any audience present to power up this engine,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Does that mean you&apos;ll be cancelling the program?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shook his head regretfully.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m afraid we&apos;re well past that point, Jurgen,&quot; he replied. &quot;The damage has been done. Not only has Spinal successfully activated...whatever this is, but thanks to the Internet and social media, this thing has become self-sustaining. Think about it, Jurgen - millions of people are watching the video and replaying it over and over again every day. They&apos;re practically powering it themselves!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what are you going to do?&quot; Jurgen asked fearfully.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Isn&apos;t it obvious?&quot; Konrad asked. &quot;I&apos;m going to beat them at their own game. I&apos;m going to keep trying to destroy Spinal before its influence becomes even stronger. Somewhere out there &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be something that can kill this goddamn thing. I&apos;m not going to wait around for the day to arrive when those powers that he&apos;s apart of shows up on our doorstep.

Pages had been torn or wrecked beyond repair, making it near impossible to determine its exact nature and/or relation to Cthulhu. The few that remained, however, indicated that it was a living gateway of some sort, although its exact nature was frustratingly obscure. It&apos;s not even clear how the damned thing was summoned. As he read further, page by page, however, part of Konrad wondered if he had been better off not having acquired the books in the first place; every time he delved deeper into books such as the Necronomicon he came away increasingly frightened. Every text and page was a horrible window that allowed him to peer into the void beyond, showing him things that made him shiver uneasily and stay up late at night, pondering some dreadful truth that he saw.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The more he read, the more threatened he felt until he finally had enough and got rid of the damn things.

After a week passed, Konrad snapped and took his frustration out on the skeleton, smashing it with his fists, beating it repeatedly with a wine bottle, yelling and screaming like a maniac for it to shut up but to no avail as it laughed in his face. Various attempts at destroying Spinal were a complete utter failure.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not even sulfuric acid can dissolve it.&quot; Konrad added bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We also have to do something about Gupte&apos;s animal,&quot; the butler replied. &quot;The last time it escaped it was a disaster.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Baron winced at the mention of the most recent incident.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago RIPTOR had somehow managed to escape from both its cell and his castle, thereby allowing it to roam free, resulting in a frantic five hour pursuit across the countryside.

On the flat brick roof of one of the castle towers, Konrad patiently waited in his wheelchair as Dieter set up the camera on the tripod while a pair of yellow, bipedal tractor-like loader android units carefully raised the massive eight by nine foot heavy duty steel shipping container up the stairs before carefully setting it down forty feet away from his position with their forklift-like arms. Another pair of loader units carried up a similar container, this one lead-lined with a label on its side that said &quot;Hazardous Materials&quot;, setting it down with a heavy thud once they reached the top.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Careful, you fools, careful!&quot; Konrad berated before muttering under his breath, &quot;Bloody machines.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Baron checked his watch. It was 12:30 A.M. He had given some of his guards some time off and had shut down cameras watching this part of the house in order to make this happen.

The column continued to move forward and grew, heading directly toward the Baron. Leaping away, Konrad barely had time to escape as he crashed to the floor, ducking down as it all washed over his wheelchair, the air around him oppressively hot. Once it died down, he glanced back to the spot where his wheelchair had been and saw nothing but the crumpled up, blackened remains and liquid metal. Following the fiery trail back to its source, Konrad narrowed his eyes angrily as Dieter hurriedly extinguished the flames.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;ARE YOU INSANE?!&quot; he bellowed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Cinder tossed his head back and laughed, his arms crossed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;That was too much fun!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; he said. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;You should have seen yourself fly out from your chair like that!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You could have killed me!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The fiery being gave a mock pause and gasp.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;You&apos;re right, whatever was I thinking?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; he said sarcastically. &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Wouldn&apos;t that have been a tragedy?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Despite the fiery covering on his face, Konrad could still sense a wicked gleam and smirk in the way Cinder looked at him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Still,&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;he continued, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;I got the job done.

I still have use for it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;From inside the container came a growling hiss, drawing the attention of both men.

Snarling, the animal tore away vast chunks of metal, hoses and wires, spilling oil and coolant out onto the roof as it tried finding something edible. Gnawing on the forklift-like arm, RIPTOR pulled away, sniffed, flickered its tongue, snorted, then lifted up its leg and urinated all over it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Well,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Cinder said, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;there&apos;s something you don&apos;t see every day.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hearing his voice, RIPTOR turned its snake-like head in his direction, staring directly at him, flickering its tongue.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mr. Ferris, if you please!&quot; Konrad said as he slowly backed away.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Cinder hesitated.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Do what?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The Baron gave an exasperated sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Kill it!&quot; he demanded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;What?!&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Cinder said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I said kill it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;No.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad blinked in incredulity.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Excuse me?&quot; he gaped.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;You didn&apos;t say anything about killing animals.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Cinder said pointedly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;For fuck&apos;s sake, man, now is hardly the time to discuss this!&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t kill animals.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;We have an agreement.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Yeah?

Konrad felt a tiny bit of satisfaction as he heard his pursuer shrieked in pain. Looking over his shoulder, he watched as the flame died down. Stumbling back, RIPTOR faltered and collapsed onto its side, trembling and whimpering. Ferris said nothing, his eyes cast down with his hands clenched into fists.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Was that so hard?&quot; The Baron muttered as he pushed himself off the ground. &quot;Now, finish it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Cinder narrowed his eyes angrily at him, then shook his head in refusal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Go to hell,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; he retorted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad&apos;s lip curled angrily.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You agreed to the terms, Ferris,&quot; he said. &quot;If you refuse-&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;What are you gonna do, lock me up?

Dieter, hand me your weapon!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking his Beretta out from his coat, the bodyguard tossed it over to him. Konrad deftly caught it with one hand, then checked to make sure the safety was off and that there was ammunition. Once he was satisfied, the aristocrat slowly approached the wounded animal as it lay there on its side, wheezing painfully. Stopping just by its chest, Konrad carefully aimed the Beretta directly at its head, his finger on the trigger. As he noisily cocked the slide, RIPTOR raised its slit eye to meet his, its form seizing up and stiffening.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Let&apos;s get this over with,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought to himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His index finger curled around the trigger, slowly applying pressure to it. He waited for the firearm to go off, for the muzzle flash to mercifully put an end to it, but as he continued making eye contact with the wounded beast before him, Konrad found himself unable to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Come on, damn you!&apos; Concentrate!&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he berated himself mentally.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad willed himself to perform the action, but his hand refused to obey.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;What the hell was the matter with him?!&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;It&apos;s a dangerous creature, a killer! A monster! It needs to be destroyed!&apos; &lt;/em&gt;he reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He thought of the people that it had killed, how it destroyed the life and soul of his friend and bodyguard Roger. Roger, an inoffensive, if not slightly dull, man who had done nothing wrong to merit the wretched ending he ended up having.

He had worked with many of them countless times throughout the years, but ever since the incident with Spinal, they came back inexplicably changed. Though they looked and sounded as they had before the incident itself and had done nothing threatening, - at least, as far as he knew, - there was a strange alien quality that greatly unnerved him and made him shudder every time. He wasn&apos;t the only one to have this impression; Dieter and Jurgen were standing stiff, eying each and everyone of them with suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter leaned in to Konrad&apos;s ear, not letting his eyes off them for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Why did you have to bring these fuckers back to work?&quot; he harshly whispered.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Some of them are under contract,&quot; Konrad said quietly back, &quot;plus they&apos;re offering services at reduced prices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wouldn&apos;t work with this group for any amount of money. You should replace them as quickly as possible,&quot; Dieter said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Duly noted,&quot; Konrad said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The bodyguard glanced at one of the cameramen, Phillips, and tilted his head in his direction, drawing the Baron&apos;s attention to him. &quot;You heard about what happened to Phillips, Baron? His family left him. When he came back that night, he had scared the absolute hell out of them, so much so that the wife took the kids and just ran away with them to her mom&apos;s and filed for divorce. He&apos;s not even fighting it. Not even his own folks want anything to do with him.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad drew in a sharp breath, then sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve heard similar stories,&quot; he whispered back. &quot;One or two families called demanding an explanation for the way they are, but my secretary and others dismissed it as being trauma from the &quot;earthquake&quot;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The director approached the trio, a short man with a white cap, beard and sunglasses, dressed in a blue formal shirt and jeans.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beautiful work with the werewolf!&quot; he murmured. &quot;Where&apos;s the Baron?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Dieter cleared his throat.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;He, ah, wanted to stay in his trailer. He has explicit instructions for everyone to not go in and disturb him,&quot; the bodyguard lied.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The director shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; he said with a dismissive wave, then gestured to Konrad. &quot;You, get in that cage, we&apos;re going to be shooting soon.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Nodding, the aristocrat quietly moved forward. Inside, a young fighter bounced around in readiness, stopping the moment he caught sight of Konrad and company. Opening the door to the cage, the former cast his glance around at the arena and at the crew, then stepped inside, closing it <text:soft-page-break/>behind him. It had been so long since he fought in a cage, and now here he was.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Dreams do come true.&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Came the bitter thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He paused momentarily as he reflected his situation with black irony; for all his life, his greatest fear was his being locked up in a cage like his father. For most of his life, however, he spent it within the confines of his mansion, a luxurious cage, and now here he was, making his public debut...in another fucking cage. He privately wondered if God was laughing at his expense.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The fighter gave him a curious look and approached Konrad, circling around him, checking him out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Whoa!&quot; the fighter cooed, impressed by the sight before him. &quot;You look absolutely incredible!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He then looked over at Dieter and Jurgen.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey fellas, who made this?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A private contractor,&quot; Dieter called.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The fighter marveled at the creature.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;So lifelike!&quot; he said as he reached out to touch him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad remained still as he poked him with a finger, then ran his hand along his fur.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You guys, this is amazing! Whoever did this really should get a clap on the back!&quot; the fighter said before deciding to reach up to touch Konrad&apos;s nose.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ahh ah ah! No touching!&quot; Dieter called. &quot;It&apos;s very sensitive equipment!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The young man waved sheepishly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sorry!&quot; he said before turning back to face Konrad himself, raising his voice. &quot;HEY BUDDY! ARE YOU OKAY IN THERE?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad nodded.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;THAT&apos;S A REALLY COOL SUIT YOU GOT ON!

Konrad played up the part of the beast with relish, snarling and growling as he slashed and snapped his jaws at his opponent, deliberately missing him with his teeth and claws. By the time the fight finished, Konrad ended the match by howling to the sky. On the sidelines, he saw Jurgen sadly watching him, staring at him. When the butler had enough, he turned around and left without saying a word, departing as Konrad continued to work.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;AND CUT!&quot; The director said from behind the camera. &quot;Very nice!

Why do you hold the tournament?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It took a long time for Konrad to find the proper words.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well?!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Tossing his head back, he gulped down his drink and exhaled in exasperation, running his clawed hands through his hair before finally spilling it out.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If a tree falls in the woods, no one will notice. I&apos;m the tree,&quot; Konrad explained.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;What the hell does that mean?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad sighed as he began to pour another cup.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;If I die exposed, I will be considered a freak. An oddity to be puzzled over, dissected and studied for years to come by the media and scientists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He paused, then set the bottle down.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;However,&quot; he continued, &quot;if I were to die on camera, on film, that&apos;s different. I&apos;d just be another dead monster. Fiction and civilization are built off of the shattered backs of fallen monsters, Jurgen. Fenrir, Jormungandr, Grendel, the Hydra, the Minotaur, Cerberus, the Chimera, Orochi, Frankenstein, Dracula, King Kong, Godzilla...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He shrugged before taking another long gulp of his drink.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of famous company,&quot; he murmured as he wiped his mouth and chin.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You shouldn&apos;t feel so proud of it!&quot; Jurgen exclaimed in anger.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I shouldn&apos;t, but what else can I do, Jurgen?&quot; Konrad said, not bothering to look at him. &quot;I am not a hero, I am a monster.

Before that time comes, however, monsters will have their day, onscreen and onscreen only.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;But you aren&apos;t just giving monsters their day - you are celebrating them!&quot; Jurgen countered in outrage. &quot;Valorizing them! Multiplying them! Marketing them! Those powers that brought Spinal into this world are growing, and the only thing you&apos;re doing is help pave the way for them by offering up your own sacrifice! You have not only embraced your status as a monster, Herr Baron, but you have also become the&lt;em&gt; father of monsters&lt;/em&gt;!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad poured himself another glass.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Maybe you&apos;re right, Jurgen,&quot; he said. &quot;But what can I do? Spinal is winning. It&apos;ll only be a matter of time before his masters kick open the door. I&apos;m old, Jurgen,...and I&apos;m tired. I&apos;m so very tired.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;And so you&apos;re just going give up now?!

He tried to say something, anything, but he stopped, desperately doing everything humanly possible to refrain from bursting into tears.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning away toward the door, Jurgen&apos;s voice hardened, &quot;If you plan on killing yourself, at least have the fucking decency to do it in private and not involve other people, let alone having them watch!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;With that, he whipped open the door and slammed it loudly against its frame behind him.

Surely Dieter-&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Since this discovery,&quot; David continued, &quot;a few of us decided to pool our efforts together in order to bring this little project to life, and now, ladies and gentlemen, we will all hear this song performed live for the first time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As people applauded, Konrad sat stiffly in his wheelchair. He wanted to get away from them all, hide in the deepest part of his castle and die. He wanted them to stop what they were doing, to say something in protest to this.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Damn you, Dieter,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought bitterly.

Lowering his head in shame while everyone listened with rapt attention as it continued to build, the Baron could only watch as the tune flooded the room, slowly increasing in volume and intensity until the full range of his work was unleashed, a violent maelstrom that overwhelmed the listener. For three minutes, it played, mesmerizing its audience. When it finally ended, people applauded and cheered, much to Konrad&apos;s discomfort and embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Bravo!

Scooping up forkfuls of white icing, he munched loudly, pausing for momentary self-reflection.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Was he eating because he was hungry?

Taking the key out from his pocket, the lock clicked as it was released. Opening it, he withdrew the burdensome item and took out a small box, the weight of the former now made even heavier by the knowledge of what he must do, his hands slick with sweat as he emptied the latter into his hand. Putting the box aside, he snapped open the side-by-side double barrel and carefully examined it. Once he was satisfied with the weapon&apos;s condition, the butler then inserted two cartridges inside while pocketing the rest, snapping the barrel back into place with an audible clack. Raising his left hand, Jurgen checked his watch.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;12:45 am.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Everyone should be asleep by now, including the Baron, but he couldn&apos;t take any chances; he had to be very careful to make sure that his work wouldn&apos;t be interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;Closing the gun cabinet, he went to the closet and found his father&apos;s sweater, a thick grey woolen thing that was old and worn with age. Feeling the material, the butler felt waves of nostalgia wash over him. He remembered the happy times with his father - how he told him stories as a boy while he had him seated on his knee in front of the fireplace. His first time hunting with him and the Baron. His first taste of beer with them, much to his mother&apos;s chagrin. Even memories of himself seated on his father&apos;s lap in the driver&apos;s seat, using the steering wheel. It was also the same sweater he wore that day when he had to perform his duty.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen sighed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Poor man,&quot; he said aloud.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;That day had destroyed him; from that point on, Jurgen&apos;s father lost all the sparkle and life in his eyes. While he was able to put on a brave face for everyone&apos;s sake, including the Baron&apos;s, and did everything he could, Jurgen knew that something had died in the man and that he would never be the same again. Ever since that incident, he turned to the bottle and hid his grief with it before ultimately dying from liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen shook his head pitifully.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;I suppose that&apos;s why Herr Baron drinks so often,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he reflected. To punish himself for what happened to Jurgen&apos;s father, a man that he had looked up to. To find or maintain some sort of connection to him. To understand how he had felt. To keep reminding himself of him. Perhaps, even, to die as he had.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kissing the sweater, Jurgen carefully wrapped it around the shotgun. Once the weapon was entirely concealed, the butler then made his way to the door and headed for Konrad&apos;s room.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A patch of yellow light flooded into the darkened room as Jurgen snuck in. Closing it slightly behind him, just enough to illuminate his surroundings and help him navigate, the butler made his way quietly to the Baron&apos;s bed, the weapon heavy in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1979&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jurgen stopped as he heard his young master crying inside his room. Raising his hand, the butler knocked gently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Herr Baron?&quot; he called.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He knocked a second time. When no answer came, he opened the door. Sitting on the bed with his back toward him, facing the opposite window, the teenager had his face lowered into his hands, sobbing furiously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;What&apos;s wrong, Herr Baron?&quot; Jurgen asked concernedly as he approached. &quot;Why are you crying?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Konrad sniffled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I-I-I broke up with Mila.&quot; he said between sobs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Oh Herr Baron,&quot; Jurgen frowned, saddened and surprised by the news. &quot;Why?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The youth shook his head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I don&apos;t-I don&apos;t want her to...&quot; he said, sniffling. He lowered his eyes, shaking his head. &quot;It&apos;s-it&apos;s not fair, Jurgen! It&apos;s just not fair!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jurgen put a comforting hand on Konrad&apos;s shoulder as he wailed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;It&apos;s okay, Herr Baron. It&apos;s okay. We&apos;ll find a cure for you in time. It&apos;s not the end of the world! You are still young! You have your whole life ahead of you!&quot; Jurgen said encouragingly. &quot;We&apos;ll find a cure.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taking in several deep breaths, Konrad raised up his head and wiped his eyes, then looked directly at the butler.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I want you to promise me something, Jurgen,&quot; he said. &quot;If I turn out just like my father or worse, I want you to kill me.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hearing those words froze the blood in Jurgen&apos;s veins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Don&apos;t say such things, Herr Baron. That will never happen.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Promise me!&quot; Konrad pressed. &quot;I don&apos;t want to end up in a cage like-like him. Promise me! I&apos;m begging you, Jurgen - promise that that won&apos;t happen to me, that you&apos;ll kill me before that time comes!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jurgen stared down, horrified by what he&apos;s hearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;If you truly care about me, Jurgen,&quot; Konrad said, &quot;then you&apos;d see to it that I&apos;d never end up like my father.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;His lips tightened into a grim line. He had no choice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Alright, Herr Baron. I promise. I promise to...put you out of your misery...when the time comes,&quot; he said, struggling with the words.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The next thing he knew, Konrad stood up and hugged him, surprising the butler as he held on tight and wept.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen stood over the bed, looking down on Konrad&apos;s features as he slept and snored loudly. He shook his head his incredulously.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Unbelievable,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought. How could anyone sleep and produce such a racket without waking themselves up? It sounded like there was a tractor in here.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Unwrapping the shotgun, the butler gently placed the sweater onto a sofa to the right of the bed, giving it a slight pat before straightening himself up. Stepping close to the foot of the bed, he lifted the weapon and aimed it directly at the Baron&apos;s head, staring down the barrel. Pulling the hammer back with his thumb, his index finger traced along the trigger hair before curling around it, his breathing slow and measured while his heart raced a marathon, beating in his ears like a tribal drum. Sweat greased both palms of his hands and his forehead as he stared down the barrel, standing over the sleeping Baron.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Exhaling nervously, he lowered the weapon.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Wait a moment, Herr Baron,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; Jurgen thought.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He wasn&apos;t ready yet. He needed to steady his nerves and find the proper mindset for this.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning to a cabinet nearby, Jurgen opened it up and rummaged around quietly, opening up drawer after drawer until finally he found what he was looking for - a bottle of red Riesling wine with two glasses. The butler quietly shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Typical,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he scoffed mentally. The Baron could always be counted on to be hiding wine somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking a glass, he opened the bottle and poured himself a drink, stopping when he thought he detected movement. Turning briskly to the doorway, the butler waited with baited breath before turning back to face the Baron.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Was he awake?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;His heart raced even faster as he watched the Baron. When the Baron snored, the butler released his breath.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Thank God,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought. If the Baron had woken up, Jurgen wouldn&apos;t have been able to go through with it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Pouring the rest of the bottle into the glass, the butler put the cork back in and placed the former away, then turned to the sleeping figure.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had hoped that I&apos;d never have to do this,&quot; he said aloud.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The figure snored in reply.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Even though you can be an enormous pain in the ass,&quot; Jurgen began, &quot;...I have always cared about you. I&apos;ve always thought of you as a little brother.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The butler leaned back against the cabinet with a weary sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;You once claimed that I was jealous of you,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad snored.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I suppose there might have been a &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; bit of truth in that,&quot; Jurgen shrugged. &quot;I never told you this...but there was a time, Herr Baron, when I...I absolutely hated you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;No acknowledgement was made.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Surprising, I know, but...&quot; the butler struggled with finding the words. Then it all came pouring <text:soft-page-break/>out. &quot;...I was sick of it. I hated you for what you were. What you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;. I hated you for what your father had done to mine. I hated the fact that my family were chained to yours and had to deal with your shit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He took a sip from his cup.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a time when I was going to walk out on all this,&quot; Jurgen admitted. &quot;Walk out on &lt;em&gt;you, &lt;/em&gt;without ever saying goodbye. It was when the change to your legs was starting to occur. You were groaning in pain and were shitting the bed, and when I tried cleaning up...I swear, it was as if you were trying to deliberately make more of a fucking mess. You&apos;d be screaming for Tylenol or something to manage your pain, and when I wasn&apos;t quick enough to get it, you&apos;d just use every insult in the book or throw things at me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He shook his head wearily.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Then one day, I just had enough. I got a suitcase and started packing all my things in. I didn&apos;t care where I went, just as long as I got away from you, otherwise I would have gone insane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen glanced over to Konrad.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you know why I stayed?&quot; Sighing, he continued, &quot;Because my mother couldn&apos;t bear the thought of leaving you on your own. Christ, how I tried reasoning with her! I begged and pleaded for her to come with me, but no matter what I said she wouldn&apos;t leave. She was so...stubborn. She wanted to stay and help you. I asked her, &quot;Why? Why would you want to stay with him?! He&apos;s a selfish little bastard whose family has caused nothing but trouble for us! His mind and body will rot away like his fucking father, so why stay around to watch a repeat of that horrible day?!&quot; You know what she said?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He took a long gulp.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;She said that she pitied you, that you needed someone by your side. Despite their wealth, the Sabrewulf family, in her eyes, were the loneliest people on the planet, and not out of choice. They &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; someone to care about them, to help them, someone to depend on. Nobody knew the harsh truth of their existence. &quot;Certainly,&quot; my mother said, &quot;there are people out there who have far, far less and are more deserving,...but everyone needs someone regardless. Everyone is entitled to a good night&apos;s sleep. Everyone deserves some...dignity and hope.&quot; She said that the most loving thing a person can do is to be there for someone, whether they want it or not.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen was still for a few minutes, then took another drink.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;After she said that, I felt like a total ass. I was completely ashamed of what I was doing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He gave a small smile.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you want to know the incredible thing, though? She wasn&apos;t upset over what I said or felt. Being a servant to a Sabrewulf was a heavy burden and would be filled with challenges. It&apos;s not a path suited for everyone, and my mother didn&apos;t begrudge anyone for not wanting to be a part of it. Not my aunts. Not my uncles...&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen stared down into his glass.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do what you feel is right,&quot; he said. &quot;Those were her last words to me before she died.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He wiped his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It took a long time for me to decide...but when she was gone, I...I realized...that...in spite of everything, …..all I had left in this world was you. And now...here we are.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking to Konrad&apos;s sleeping form, Jurgen held up his glass to him.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;To all the good times we had together, Herr Baron,&quot; he said before downing his drink. Once he finished, the butler put his glass onto the cabinet behind him, straightened himself up.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Exhaling through his nostrils, he nodded to himself. He felt much better now. His mind was clear and his nerves were steady. All that was left was to put the Baron to rest. Jurgen quietly stepped toward the Baron with weapon in hand, inching closer and closer until finally he loomed directly over the aristocrat himself. Raising up the shotgun, he aimed the barrel directly over Konrad&apos;s head. Pulling his thumb back on the hammer, his index finger settling on the trigger piece, Jurgen steadied his breathing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Auf Wiedersehn, alter Freund,&quot; he whispered as a tear ran down his cheek, his finger tightening around the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;At that moment, the door crashed open.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;BARON!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Jurgen heard several loud cracks and felt a sharp pain that lasted only a second, then nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad stared wide-eyed with shock as the lights came on and illuminated the fallen form that lay bleeding by his bedside.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;No,&quot; he murmured as he flung aside the covers. &quot;No, no, no, no.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kneeling down, Konrad gently touched Jurgen&apos;s face, then looked up at the bodyguard.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dieter,&quot; he said in a quiet, tiny voice, his lower lip quivering, &quot;what have you done?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;He was going to kill you, Baron,&quot; Dieter said as he holstered his sidearm. &quot;It was dark.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The aristocrat gently shook the still form.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jurgen? Jurgen?&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Are you okay? Please say something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Tears dropped onto the dead man&apos;s face.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Jurgen, please!&quot; Konrad pled. &quot;Please wake up! I need you! Please! Please.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Kneeling beside him, Dieter checked for a pulse. After a minute, the bodyguard frowned and shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, Baron.&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad carefully picked up the dead butler and hugged him, his left hand cradling the back of his head as he wept loudly and uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As Dieter watched the scene before him, a single thought crossed his mind. It was something that he had often wondered, something that he had meant to ask the Baron many times, but seeing it for himself was confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Werewolves &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; cry.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:line-break/></text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">15. Epilogue</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epilogue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;If I am the chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers, also.&quot; - &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Louis Stevenson, &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Five years had passed since that fateful day. With Jurgen gone, Konrad started to suffer severe bouts of depression and became increasingly withdrawn from everyone, Dieter especially, despite his best efforts to keep the Baron active and from sinking into a total blackhole. His mind seemed to be slipping away from him; there would be times where he would catch himself muttering something aloud without even realizing, sometimes forgetting certain details.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Even worse was the sheer crushing sense of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He felt alone in a way he never thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad tried reaching out to someone, anyone. Part of him wanted to call a hotline, but Konrad was too proud and reluctant to do so. Once, he had attempted calling Mila&apos;s house, not knowing why.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Perhaps to apologise? Perhaps because he just wanted to hear a voice and craved human contact? To explain himself? That he had been thinking of her? Boredom? The truth was that Konrad himself was uncertain as to the actual reason. Perhaps there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; no reason behind it all.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;When someone finally answered, he found himself unsure what to say. Muttering that he called the wrong number, Konrad hung up and sat there in his bedroom, staring blankly at the wall. On most occasions, he remained in bed, only getting up when he either needed to go to the bathroom or wanted to get something to eat or drink, both of which brought little enthusiasm to the aristocrat. It was only through Dieter&apos;s constant pushing that he was able to get anything done. Reluctantly pushing himself out from his bed and settling into his wheelchair, he put on his apparel with indifference. Not even bothering to check himself, he rolled himself out from his room, deciding to <text:soft-page-break/>pay a visit to his increasingly growing menagerie of horrors.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;In the dungeon, Konrad saw RIPTOR feasting on the remains of some animal, he couldn&apos;t tell what. Tearing a large chunk of flesh from its prey&apos;s ribcage, the beast paid him no mind as it hungrily consumed its meal.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;In the freezer, he saw Glacius give him curious looks, purring and whistling in its native tongue as he passed by.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Peering into the upgraded containment chamber, he saw Cinder doing pushups as he was being monitored by scientists, his head and face entirely concealed within a metallic featureless mask, while parts of his emaciated and fiery body were armored with wires protruding from the arms. On his back between the shoulder blades, held in place by four screws was a constantly running turbine that helped decrease his temperature and maintain pressure. Glancing up to the Baron without even pausing, Cinder&apos;s fiery eyes narrowed disgustedly in his direction as he gave him the middle finger.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Drawing open the slots, Konrad peered into the tiny windows and saw his newest additions.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;In one heavily reinforced cell was a massive figure, an eight foot tall hunchbacked being with crudely designed and awkwardly proportioned arms, hand and feet. Made from bronze with parts missing, it was held together by various vines, plant life and rocks, its left arm a massive vine-wrapped, sharp-faced boulder. A mishmash of styles, notably Akkadian, Mycenaean, and Archaic, the metal green from age, its head was an Archaic-styled sculpture that had three distinct faces with geometrically-patterned, zig-zagging beards on its chins, two of which had archaic smiles, while the third sculpted face in the middle was drawn into an angry wrathful expression with an open mouth. Kneeling on one knee, it sat unmoving from its position.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Taking out an emerald from his cloak, Konrad studied the jewel that had been embedded in its forehead, then glanced to the empty space from where it had been removed. To think something so small was capable of animating something so large and powerful as the golem was incredible to him. Without it, the thing was immobile.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Turning away from the golem, Konrad regarded the next creature, a being that he absolutely abhorred and feared far more than its neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;A pale girl with long black hair sat in the center of its containment cell. Dressed in the tattered remnants of a red kimono that was held in place by a red obi sash around the waist and decorated with white lotus flower designs, she held within both hands a long naginata that had a red ribbon tied around the blade, staring at the floor in silence.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shuddered as he stared at the creature.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Even though she was the smallest within his gallery, only five-four in height, and was seemingly passive, he didn&apos;t allow himself for even a moment to fall for her deceptively frail appearance, for the last person that had was twisted into impossible and gruesome shapes. When she raised her eyes to meet his, Konrad slammed the slot shut instantly and fled, his fur standing on end.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Peering down from a catwalk that overlooked a surgical amphitheater, Konrad saw clusters of doctors and researchers surround a single subject. Strapped to a table was a sleek though imposing mechanical figure; while nowhere near as large as either the golem or RIPTOR, it was tall, about six-five in height and weighed over five hundred and sixty pounds. Grey in color with ball-joint limbs, it had a featureless faceplate with a skull-like head and an orange pony tail at the top. Snaking out from beneath its cheeks on both sides of its &quot;face&quot; were two pairs of cables that looped out, one pair connecting to the back of its head while another looped around its shoulders. On its robust arms were a pair of curved, scythe-like blades.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:soft-page-break/>&lt;p&gt;&quot;Testing in three...two...one,&quot; a researcher counted down before typing into a nearby monitor.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The lenses flickered on. Staring up at him with hellishly slanted glowing red eyes that formed a perpetually drawn angry death glare, its body outlined by the blue hues of its superheated plasma blades, Konrad shuddered as he witnessed the birth of Fulgore. With the harsh chiaroscuro lighting and the way in which hues illuminated parts of its body, it looked almost like an angel of death that had been granted physical form.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Troubled by how it seemed to watch him, Konrad quickly turned away, rolling along the catwalk.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As he tirelessly maneuvered around the mansion, he looked to the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;What have I done wrong?&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Hadn&apos;t he done everything he could to be a better person? Hadn&apos;t he tried being a good person? Why was he being punished? What kind of a bastard was he in life to suffer the way he has to?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Things were going so terribly wrong, and at the same time, so terribly right. Letting out a weary sigh, Konrad rolled down a corridor, pondering to himself.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Later, he found himself lying face first on the sofa in his private den, watching television. Reaching out with his remote control, he flicked indifferently through the channels, uncaring for whatever was shown on screen before stopping as an advert caught his attention.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Available for your home for $19.95, &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; uncut and uncensored!&quot; a voice boomed.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He impassively watched the commercial as it showcased various fights with voice-over commentary. Flicking it off, he pushed himself up and moved to his messy desk, staring at the various cluttered toys and posters of varying sizes, his eyes narrowing at the title and tagline of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Coming soon: &quot;Killer Instinct&quot;. Monsters will have their day.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Clenching his fists, he swatted the toys away with a frustrated yell before collapsing into his wheelchair, cupping his head into his hands. As if in reply, a laugh echoed from upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Looking to the ceiling, Konrad&apos;s lips curled angrily. Leaving the room, the aristocrat rolled through the mansion aimlessly until finally he decided on a little visit.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;hr noshade=&quot;&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;It struggled to get loose from its bindings.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Staring with hate and loathing, Konrad regarded the little shit.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s over, you bastard,&quot; the former muttered. &quot;Get your own errand boy to do your masters&apos; bidding. I&apos;m finished.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;The skeleton tilted its head, its glowing red eyes watching him. Looking away, Konrad glanced to the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;That will due.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Climbing onto his wheelchair, he then tossed up a long cord of rope over a wooden beam, then grabbed the other end and tied it into a knot. Testing it, he checked to make sure it was taut and secure. Once he felt certain that it would hold, the Baron began to tie the rest around his neck. He was tired of living, and he would be damned if he stayed around for another minute. He didn&apos;t care what happened to his estate or the company. He didn&apos;t even care anymore about the creatures in his house.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;They can all go to hell,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought with loathing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;After thirty-five years of struggling and worrying, it will all come to an end, and he looked forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Nobody will care,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought grimly. Not Dieter. Not David. Especially not Mila.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;What was there to live for?&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;For every attempt made to find a cure, for every artifact discovered, it results disaster, in a new <text:soft-page-break/>monster being brought into the fold. He was tired of being the sheepdog to whatever shit joke the universe has in store.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once he finished tying, Konrad waited, sighing.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;This is it!&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought. End of the line.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, Konrad kicked the wheelchair out from underneath him, then felt the rope jerk tightly around his throat. He gagged as his throat constricted, his lungs burning as he struggled to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Just a little bit longer! Just a little bit longer!&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought determinedly. His vision was starting to fade and lose focus.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Almost there!&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;As his vision darkened, Konrad allowed himself to smile for the first time in ages.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He was starting to feel happy, the happiest he had been in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;It will be all over soon,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought assuredly.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;He didn&apos;t care whether he went to heaven or not - he just wanted to be free!&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Seconds counted by as his eyes bugged out from their sockets.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;After thirty-five years of suffering, Konrad will finally come to a merciful end.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Almost-&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;An audible snap interrupted Konrad&apos;s thoughts as he painfully crashed to the floor, causing Spinal to howl uproariously with laughter. Pushing himself up with a groan, the Baron examined the rope, wondering what the hell happened, then found his answer.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Figures,&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he thought as he chucked the pieces aside. The rope had snapped underneath his heavy weight.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&apos;Well what else did you expect to happen when you&apos;re as fat as a fucking pig?!&apos;&lt;/em&gt; he self-admonished.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Even when it came to killing himself, Konrad was a fuckup.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Baron! Are you okay?&quot; he heard Dieter call from below.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad shook his head with a frown. Shit.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, I&apos;m fine!&quot; he called back.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Creaking up the ladder, the bodyguard pulled himself up.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you hurt?! What happened?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Konrad waved him away.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s fine, mein freund, it&apos;s fine,&quot; he assured. &quot;I just tripped on some damn toy. Go back down, I&apos;ll meet you there in a second.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you sure?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ja, ja.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;Once Dieter was gone, Konrad sat still for a moment. It would seem fate didn&apos;t want him to die today. Picking himself off the floor, Konrad dusted himself off and made his descent back down, dreading what tomorrow would bring.&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;The gods have many shapes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gods bring many things to their accomplishment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what was most expected has not been accomplished. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But god has found his way for what no man expected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So ends this story.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - Euripides, &quot;The Bacchae&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</text:p><text:p text:style-name="justified"><text:line-break/></text:p></office:text></office:body></office:document-content>
